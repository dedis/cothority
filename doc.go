package cothority

/*
This repository implements a of the collective authority (cothority) framework.
The system is based on CoSi, a novel protocol for collective signing
which itself builds on Schnorr multi-signatures over elliptic curves.
CoSi enables authorities to have their statements collectively signed
(co-signed) by a diverse, decentralized, and scalable group of
(potentially thousands of) witnesses and, for example, could be employed
to proactively harden critical Internet authorities.
Among other things, one could imagine applications to Certificate
Transparency, DNSSEC, software distribution, the Tor anonymity
network, and cryptocurrencies.
