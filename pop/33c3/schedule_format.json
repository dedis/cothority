Rising superpowers around the world are working day and night to build the next stealth drone that can penetrate air defense systems. The automation of target selection processes, navigation and control are incentivized by the vulnerability posed by the signals drones rely upon to operate.\r\n\r\nA drone is merely a networked platform that moves across a grid, much like a mouse. It\u2019s \u201emind\u201c is distributed among dozens of individuals located around the globe, controlling separate parts of the the overall mission using data derived from surveillance, and processed using algorithms that may or may not reflect the reality on the ground. Cian challenges the common notion that drones are the most effective tool for combatting terrorism and seeks to explain why this is so, as well as how mistakes happen. The automation of these processes will further take the responsibility out of the hands of individuals and disperse them further. This calls for a new level of ethical considerations and accountability mechanisms to be developed.",

I will also discuss the extra-legal pressures placed upon companies, and the rise of government hacking and state-sponsored malware as an alternative or addition to weakening software. Finally, the presentation will discuss possible realistic outcomes, and give my predictions on what the state of the law will be as we head into 2017, and discuss how we can fight for a future that will allow for secure communications for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe discussion will include:\r\n- The law and policy issues in the FBI v. Apple iPhone case,\r\n- The FBI\u2019s purchase of 0day access to the iPhone 5c, and Apple\u2019s technical response,\r\n- The rise in use of government malware to access encrypted device\r\n-  Proposed and enacted crypto laws in the United States, Australia, India, Russia, and the UK,\r\n- Legal pressures on companies, like Brazil\u2019s arrest of Facebook executives to pressure WhatsApp,\r\n- Q&A with the audience.",

Unlike Tails, which aims to be a stateless OS that leaves no trace on the computer of its presence, Heads is intended for the case where you need to store data and state on the computer. It targets specific models of commodity hardware and takes advantage of lessons learned from several years of vulnerability research. This talk provides a high level overview of Heads, a demo of installing it on a Thinkpad and a tour of some of the attacks that it protects against.",
                                "description": "Heads builds on several years of firmware security research focused on firmware vulnerabilities (\"Thunderstrike: EFI bootkits for Apple Macbooks\" and \"Thunderstrike 2\") as well as many other CCC talks (\"Hardening hardware and choosing a #goodBIOS\", \"Beyond anti evil maid\", \"Towards (reasonably) trustworthy x86 laptops\", etc.) and combines these ideas into a single system.\r\n\r\nIt is not just another Linux distribution - it combines physical hardening and flash security features with custom Coreboot firmware and a Linux boot loader in ROM.  This moves the root of trust into the write-protected ROM and prevents further modifications to the bootup code.  Controlling the first instruction the CPU executes allows Heads to measure every step of the boot process into the TPM, which makes it possible to attest to the user or a remote system that the firmware has not been tampered with.  While modern Intel CPUs require binary blobs to boot, these non-Free components are included in the measurements and are at least guaranteed to be unchanging.  Once the system is in a known good state, the TPM is used as a hardware key storage to decrypt the drive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the hypervisor, kernel and initrd images are signed by keys controlled by the user, and the OS uses a signed, immutable root filesystem so that any software exploits that attempt to gain persistence will be detected.  While all of these firmware and software changes don't secure the system against every possible attack vector, they address several classes of attacks against the boot process and physical hardware that have been neglected in traditional installations, hopefully raising the difficulty beyond what most attackers are willing to spend.",

With a \"Mobile First\" strategy, many set their sights on bringing all financial tasks\u2014checking the account balance, making transactions, arranging investments, and ordering an overdraft\u2014on your smartphone. In a business area that was once entirely committed to security, Fintechs make a hip design and outstanding user experience their one and only priority. Even though this strategy is rewarded by rapidly increasing customer numbers, it also reveals a flawed understanding of security. With the example of the pan-European banking startup N26 (formerly Number26), we succeeded independently from the used device to leak customer data, manipulate transactions, and to entirely take over accounts to ultimately issue arbitrary transactions\u2014even without credit.",
                                "description": "Over the last few years, smartphones have become an omnipresent device that almost everybody owns and carries around all the time. Although financial institutions usually react conservatively to new technologies and trends, most established banks today offer their customers banking apps and app-based second-factor authentication methods. Fintechs, technology startups in the financial sector, pressure the tried and trusted structure of established banks, as they highlight the customer\u2019s smartphone as the hub of their financial life. This business model is especially appealing to younger customers. FinTechs, however, also play an important role in the advancing downfall of important conceptual security measures. While the latter can be understood as the next step in the decay process of second-factor authentication, which was started with the introduction of app-based legitimization methods, FinTechs also reveal limited insights into conceptual and technical security. We have encountered severe vulnerabilities at the Berlin-based FinTech N26, which offers their smartphone-only bank account to many countries throughout Europe. Entirely independent of the used device, we were not only able to reveal N26 customers and to manipulate transactions in real-time but also to completely take over a victim\u2019s bank account.",

We maintain that there is never a single cause, and every mistake a pilot may make has causes, and other factors contributing to it. We use the notion of a \"necessary causal factor\" to investigate the causes of accidents, and almost invariable there is a combination of both technical and human causal factors.\r\n\r\nI will look in some detail at accidents in which a combination of a technical problem, misleading or missing indications, and inappropriate (but often understandable) crew actions contributed to an accident, and also some in which unprecedented actions of the human crew turned a problem with potentially fatal consequences into a survivable accident.\r\n\r\nAutomation in modern airliners has become so reliable and useful that it may be argued that it leads to a deterioration of hand-flying skills and, perhaps more importantly, of decision-making skills.\r\n\r\nSample accident cases will include Asiana Flight 214, Spanair Flight 5022, Turkish Flight 1951, TAM Flight 3054 and others. I will also briefly touch on technical and ethical problems with self-driving vehicles highlighted by the recent Tesla crash as well as increasing automation in General Aviation and its consequences.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I will look at ways to improve safety and maintain the very high standard currently achieved in commercial aviation.",

                                "description": "This talk will hand you all the tools you need to go deeply into hacking smart devices. And you should! The only reason a huge bunch of these products doesn't even implement the most basic security mechanisms, might be that we don't hack them enough!\r\n\r\nWe start by looking at the hardware layer, dissecting PCBs and showing which chips are usually used for building those devices. Even if the firmware is read protected they still can be used as nice devboards with unusual pheripherals - if you can't flash it, you don't own it!\r\n\r\nBut you don't always have to get out your JTAG interfaces. The most simple part is intercepting an Apps communication with its servers. We show an easy Man-in-the-middle setup, which on the fly breaks the TLS encryption and lets you read and manipulate the data flowing through. This was enough to completely defeat the restrictions on a locks \"share to a friend\" feature and of course helps you recover your password...\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the API also is the best way to actually OWN your device - giving you the option to replace the vendors cloud service with an own backend. We show how this can be for example used to continue using your bike lock when the kickstarter you got it from goes bankrupt after a presentation about it's bad crypto. Just kidding, they are already notified and working on a patch. \r\n\r\nAlso going for the wireless interface and sniffing BTLE isn't as difficult as it might sound. Turning a cheap 10 EUR devboard into a sniffer we show how to use Wireshark to dissect the packets going from and to the device and analyze the payload. In some cases this is all what's needed to get the secret key from a single interaction...\r\n\r\nFinally we will turn into reverse engineers, showing how to decompile an android app and analyze it's inner working or even modify it to your needs. Using this we show, that a quite popular electronic padlock indeed correctly claims to use AES128, but due to a silly key exchange mechanism we can break it by listening to a single opening command. All details of this 0-day attack will be released during the talk - the vendor has been notified in May.\r\n\r\nLast but not least we will go back for the hardware layer, showing that sometimes even simple things like magnets or shims can be used to defeat $80+ electronic locks in seconds...",

But what do you do now?\r\n\r\nIn the past, console homebrew usually focused on bringing up a development environment similar to the one used for commercial games. However, with the increasing complexity of console hardware, it's becoming impractical for a small team of hackers to create a full blown development SDK. Using leaked official SDKs is illegal. What can we do? Well, there's Linux.\r\n\r\nThe PS4 is particularly great for Linux, because it is based on a modified x86 platform and a modified Radeon GPU. That means that once the basic OS port is complete, it can run existing games - even Steam games and other commercial software. But just how similar is the PS4 to a PC? Can you just throw GRUB on it and boot an Ubuntu kernel? Not quite.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll cover the PS4 hardware and part of its software environment, and how we reverse engineered enough of it to write Linux drivers and kernel patches. We'll go over how we went from basic code execution to building a 'kexec' function that can boot into Linux from the PS4's FreeBSD-based kernel. We'll reverse engineer the PS4's special hardware, from special PCI interrupt management to the HDMI encoder.  We'll dive deep into the Radeon-based GPU architecture, and we'll share some previously unreleased research and tools of interest to AMD Radeon driver developers and hackers.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the strange world of x86 hardware that isn't quite a PC, then this talk is for you.",

Currently, they broadcast an L-band signal from 3 Inmarsat satellites, giving them almost worldwide coverage. The bitrate of the signal is 2kbps (or 20MB of content per day), and they use the signal to broadcast Wikipedia pages, weather information and other information of public interest.\r\n\r\nMost of the software used for Outernet is open source, but the key parts of their receiver are closed source and the protocols and specifications of the signal used are secret. I think this is contrary to the goal of providing free worldwide access to internet contents. Therefore, I have worked to reverse engineer the protocols and build an open source receiver.

We introduce two versions of the attack. The more general form exploits multiple unnoticed protocol flaws in SSLv2 to develop a new and stronger variant of the Bleichenbacher RSA padding-oracle attack. The victim client never initiates SSLv2 connections. We implemented the attack and can decrypt a TLS 1.2 handshake using 2048-bit RSA in under 8 hours, at a cost of $440 on Amazon EC2. Using Internet-wide scans, we find that 33% of all HTTPS servers and 22% of those with browser-trusted certificates are vulnerable to this protocol-level attack due to widespread key and certificate reuse.\r\n\r\nFor an even cheaper attack, we apply our new techniques together with a newly discovered vulnerability in OpenSSL that was present in releases from 1998 to early 2015. Given an unpatched SSLv2 server to use as an oracle, we can decrypt a TLS ciphertext in one minute on a single CPU\u2014fast enough to enable man-in-the-middle attacks against modern browsers. We find that 26% of HTTPS servers are vulnerable to this attack.\r\n\r\nThis talk gives an overview on the DROWN vulnerability for the hacker community with some background information that didn\u2019t make it to the paper.",

                                "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. We show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language\u2014the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model\u2014namely, the GloVe word embedding\u2014trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.",
                                "description": "There is no Alice and Bob in this talk. This talk is intended for an audience that genuinely cares for humanity and believes in equality while supporting fairness and acts against discrimination. This talk might not be interesting for folks who promote exclusion while discouraging diversity. Many of us have felt excluded in certain situations because of our gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, disabilities, or physical appearance. This talk aims to communicate how big data driven machine learning is pushing the society towards discrimination, unfairness, and prejudices that harm billions of people every single day.\r\n\r\nThis year, I will not talk about de-anonymizing programmers, re-identifying underground forum members, or anonymous writing. I will be talking about a human right, namely equality, and the issue of unfairness which happens to be embedded in machines that make decisions about our future, what we see and read, or whether we go to prison or not.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMachine learning models are widely used for various applications that end up affecting billions of people and Internet users every day. Random forest classifiers guide the U.S. drone program to predict couriers that can lead to terrorists in Pakistan. Employers use algorithms, which might be racist, to aid in employment decisions. Insurance companies determine health care or car insurance rates based on machine learning outcomes. Internet search results are personalized according to machine learning models, which are known to discriminate against women by showing advertisements with lower salaries, while showing higher paying job advertisements for men. On the other hand, natural language processing models are being used for generating text and speech, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and sentence completion, which collectively influence search engine results, page ranks, and the information presented to all Internet users within filter bubbles. Given the enormous and unavoidable effect of machine learning algorithms on individuals and society, we attempt to uncover implicit bias embedded in machine learning models, focusing particularly on word embeddings. We show empirically that natural language necessarily contains human biases, and the paradigm of training machine learning on language corpora means that AI will inevitably imbibe these biases as well. \r\n\r\nWe look at \u201cword embeddings\u201d, a state-of-the-art language representation used in machine learning. Each word is mapped to a point in a 300-dimensional vector space so that semantically similar words map to nearby points. We show that a wide variety of results from psychology on human bias can be replicated using nothing but these word embeddings. We primarily look at the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a widely used and accepted test of implicit bias. The IAT asks subjects to pair concepts together (e.g., white/black-sounding names with pleasant or unpleasant words) and measures reaction times as an indicator of bias. In place of reaction times, we use the semantic closeness between pairs of words. In short, we were able to replicate every single implicit bias result that we tested, with high effect sizes and low p-values.\r\n\r\nThese include innocuous, universal associations (flowers are associated with pleasantness and insects with unpleasantness), racial prejudice (European-American names are associated with pleasantness and African-American names with unpleasantness), and a variety of gender stereotypes (for example, career words are associated with male names and family words with female names). We look at nationalism, mental health stigma, and prejudice towards the elderly. We also look at word embeddings generated from German text to investigate prejudice based on German data. We do not cherry pick any of these IATs, they have been extensively performed by millions of people from various countries and they are also available for German speakers (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/germany/).\r\n\r\nWe go further. We show that information about the real world is recoverable from word embeddings to a striking degree. We can accurately predict the percentage of U.S. workers in an occupation who are women using nothing but the semantic closeness of the occupation word to feminine words! These results simultaneously show that the biases in question are embedded in human language, and that word embeddings are picking up the biases. \r\n\r\nOur finding of pervasive, human-like bias in AI may be surprising, but we consider it inevitable. We mean \u201cbias\u201d in a morally neutral sense. Some biases are prejudices, which society deems unacceptable. Others are facts about the real world (such as gender gaps in occupations), even if they reflect historical injustices that we wish to mitigate. Yet others are perfectly innocuous. Algorithms don\u2019t have a good way of telling these apart. If AI learns language sufficiently well, it will also learn cultural associations that are offensive, objectionable, or harmful. At a high level, bias is meaning. \u201cDebiasing\u201d these machine models, while intriguing and technically interesting, necessarily harms meaning.\r\n\r\nInstead, we suggest that mitigating prejudice should be a separate component of an AI system. Rather than altering AI\u2019s representation of language, we should alter how or whether it acts on that knowledge, just as humans are able to learn not to act on our implicit biases. This requires a long-term research program that includes ethicists and domain experts, rather than formulating ethics as just another technical constraint in a learning system.\r\nFinally, our results have implications for human prejudice. Given how deeply bias is embedded in language, to what extent does the influence of language explain prejudiced behavior? And could transmission of language explain transmission of prejudices? These explanations are simplistic, but that is precisely our point: in the future, we should treat these as \u201cnull hypotheses\u2019\u2019 to be eliminated before we turn to more complex accounts of bias in humans.",

Und auch ihre Form beschr\u00e4nkt sich nicht auf Facebook-Posts und klassische Stammtischgespr\u00e4che, wie ein Blick auf die gesammelten Daten zeigt.\r\n\r\nIm Talk wollen wir au\u00dferdem der Frage nachgehen, wer die Akteure sind, die Ger\u00fcchte verbreiten oder gar erst in die Welt setzen. An Beispielen werden wir betrachten, welche politische Wirkung Ger\u00fcchte entfalten k\u00f6nnen und wom\u00f6glich auch sollen.\r\n\r\nWir m\u00f6chten aber auch zeigen, wie einfach es zumindest auf technischer Ebene ist, mit Werkzeugen, die das Netz zur Verf\u00fcgung stellt, gegen rassistische Zerrbilder vorzugehen.",

                                "description": "Version 1.3 is the latest Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. TLS is the S in HTTPS.\r\n\r\nA lot has changed between 1.2 (2008) and 1.3. At the a high level, 1.3 saves a round-trip, making most connections much faster to establish. We'll see how the 1.2 handshake worked, and what had to change to enable 1-RTT handshakes.\r\n\r\nBut even more importantly, the 1.3 design shifted towards putting robustness first. Anything that is not strictly necessary to the main function of TLS was removed (compression, renegotiation); choices of suboptimal security aren't offered at all (static RSA, CBC, RC4, SHA1, MD5); secure, easy to implement designs are introduced or privileged (RSA-PSS, AEAD implicit nonces, full handshake signatures, Curve25519, resumption forward secrecy). We will go into the why and how of all of these.\r\n\r\nBut two major trade-offs had to be made: first, 1-RTT handshakes inherently prevent the introduction of encrypted domain names (SNI). We'll see why and what can replace them to provide similar privacy.\r\n\r\nMost interestingly, 1.3 comes with 0-RTT resumption. The catch there is that the protocol itself provides no complete protection against replay attacks. We'll unpack the problem, see what mitigations are available, what the risks and attacks are and how that requires careful API design and deployment.\r\n\r\nFinally, deployment hasn't been entirely smooth. Many servers out there turned out to be intolerant to 1.3 clients. We'll see what this causes, how it was worked around, and how downgrade protection provides defense in depth.\r\n\r\nTLS 1.3 is not in the distant future. The draft is almost finalized, and at Cloudflare we developed an open source stack in Go and support the protocol in beta for all websites. Chrome Canary and Firefox Nightly implement 1.3 clients.",

Software\r\nmisconfiguration like with unprotected key-value stores and  software bugs like\r\nheartbleed are analyzed and investigated in the wild using scanning of\r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\nAt least since the rise of zMap, scanning the I---Pv4---nternet has become a\r\nrather simple endeavour. When one happens to be at a conference that tends to\r\nsupply 1gE or 10gE ports on the access layer, scanning the Internet can be done\r\nin 60-10 Minutes. Scanning the 2^32 possible addresses (with certain\r\nlimitations) of IPv4 has become cheap.\r\n\r\nHowever, the small searchspace of IPv4 that makes it so scannable is also what\r\nrenders it increasingly obsolete. To overcome this issue, IPv6 was designed.\r\nAlong with IPv6 we receive a theoretical maximum of 2^128 different addresses.\r\nScanning this larger space is a challenge that---so far---has been mostly\r\napproached by researchers. Specifically, not security but network measurement\r\nresearchers. Their works usually focus on having access to large datasets of \r\nIPv6 addresses, the most famous ones using the access logs of a large CDN. \r\n\r\nWith the average nerd lacking a small enterprise scale CDN in the basement, we \r\nset out to utilize other techniques for enumerating IPv6 that only utilizes\r\npublic data sources. Following RFC7707, we found various interesting candidate\r\ntechniques. Especially probing the PTR sets of IPv6 networks sounded promising.\r\n\r\nHowever, when implementing the techniques, we had to realize that these were not\r\nyet ready to be used on a global scale. During the last couple of months we \r\ndiscovered pitfalls, adjusted the tools and ran enumerations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present the approaches we used to enumerate IPv6. From\r\nthis presentation, the average person in the audience should be able to easily\r\nimplement these tools for them self---with subsequent \"spasz am geraet\".\r\nFurthermore, we will present anecdotes, case-studies and investigations on the\r\ndata we gathered so far. This includes peeks into transit networks of large\r\nISPs, datacenters of global cloud providers and a suprisingly high amount of\r\nthings one would not expect (or hope to be) on the Internet.\r\n",

                                "description": "When hunting for bugs, the focus is mostly on the software layer. On the other hand, hardware is often considered as an abstract layer that behaves correctly, just executing instructions and outputing a result. However, the internal state of the hardware leaks information about the programs that are running. Unlike software bugs, these bugs are not easy to patch on current hardware, and manufacturers are also reluctant to fix them in future generations, as they are tightly tied with performance optimizations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we focus on how to extract information from the execution of simple x86 instructions that do not require any privileges. The most studied microarchitectural attacks are beyond doubt cache attacks. Indeed, the timing of a memory access depends heavily on the state of the CPU cache. But beyond memory accesses that are the base of classical cache-based side-channel attacks, other x86 instructions leak information about the internal state of the hardware, and thus about running programs. First, we present side channels caused by the \"clflush\" instruction, that flushes all content of the cache. We will explain how it can be used to perform side-channel attacks that are faster and stealthier than their classical counterpart, without performing so much as a single memory access [1]. Second, we present side channels caused by the prefetch instructions. We will explain how these instructions can be used to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses - without the use of the proc interface that is restricted today -, and to bypass kernel ASLR [2].\r\n\r\nThis talk does not require any knowledge about assembly.

Most if not all SDRs in the affordable price range are using USB2/USB3 as a transport, because of implementation simplicity. While being so popular, USB has limited bandwidth, high latency and is not really suitable for embedded applications. PCIe/miniPCIe is the only widespread bus which is embedded friendly, low latency and high bandwidth at the same time. But implementing PCIe/miniPCIe is not for the faint of heart - you have to write your own FPGA code, write your own Linux kernel driver and ensure compatibility with different chipsets, each with its own quirks. In this talk we will look at the requirements for a high performance SDR like XTRX, how this leads to certain design decisions and share pitfalls and gotchas we encountered (and solved).",

We created ClockTamer configurable clock source and UmTRX SDR and built a complete base station (UmSITE) to run OpenBTS and later Osmocom GSM stacks. This year we've started working on a new tiny high-performance SDR called XTRX which fits into the miniPCIe form-factor and using PCIe for the I/Q samples transfer.\r\n\r\nWe will talk about when to use PCIe and when not to use PCIe and why did we choose it for XTRX; FPGA implementation of PCIe with optimization for low latency and high throughput; Linux kernel driver for this PCIe device; integration with various SDR platforms; all the various issues we encountered and how you can avoid them.",

                                "description": "Es hat drei Jahre gebraucht, um die nutzerunfreundliche Praktik des Routerzwangs endlich gesetzlich f\u00fcr ung\u00fcltig zu erkl\u00e4ren. Diese erm\u00f6glicht es Internetanbietern, ihren Kunden ein Endger\u00e4t aufzuzwingen, auf das sie nur geringen Einfluss nehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlimmer noch: Will man einen eigenen Router anschlie\u00dfen, etwa weil man bestimmte technische Dienste ben\u00f6tigt, Ger\u00e4te auf Basis Freier Software bevorzugt oder ein stromsparenderes Modell einsetzen m\u00f6chte, ist dies bei vielen Anbietern entweder gar nicht m\u00f6glich oder man wird bei Support-Anfragen diskriminiert. Dieses Verhalten von Providern ist in vielerlei Hinsicht h\u00f6chst problematisch, da es hohe Sicherheitsrisiken f\u00fcr Nutzer birgt, fairen Wettbewerb verzerrt und den technologischen Fortschritt hemmt.\r\n\r\nUnd seit einigen Monaten steht die EU-Richtlinie f\u00fcr Funkabschottung auf unserer Agenda, die m\u00f6glicherweise schon bald die Nutzung und Entwicklung von Freier Software auf allen Ger\u00e4ten, die in irgendeiner Art Funkwellen verwenden, enorm einschr\u00e4nkt.\r\n\r\nDie Free Software Foundation Europe, f\u00fcr die der Referent Max Mehl arbeitet, hat schon seit den ersten Debatten vor \u00fcber drei Jahren gegen den Routerzwang angek\u00e4mpft und dabei viele Erfahrungen gesammelt. In Zusammenarbeit mit Freie-Software-Entwicklern, Organisationen wie dem Chaos Computer Club oder Digitalcourage, sowie mit Endger\u00e4teherstellern, Verb\u00e4nden und Politik ist es gelungen, den Routerzwang gesetzlich offiziell ab Sommer 2016 zu beenden.\r\n\r\nEin wesentlicher Grund f\u00fcr den Erfolg der Initiative war die Einigkeit innerhalb der Allianz gegen den Routerzwang, dass dieses Problem nur politisch gel\u00f6st werden kann. Technisch g\u00e4be es f\u00fcr einige der aufgelisteten Kritikpunkte sicherlich kurzfristig L\u00f6sungen, doch aus Erfahrung wissen wir, dass das ein Kampf gegen Windm\u00fchlen w\u00e4re und sich das Grundproblem nur weiter verfestigen w\u00fcrde. Dasselbe Ziel verfolgen wir auch f\u00fcr die Funkabschottung.\r\n\r\nDer Referent will daher dazu ermutigen, dass sich mehr Menschen f\u00fcr politische L\u00f6sungen von \u00e4hnlichen Missst\u00e4nden einsetzen. Dazu wird er zum einen den Verlauf des Routerzwangs kurz zusammenfassen und dann anhand dessen skizzieren, wie \u00e4hnliche Probleme \u2013 im Gro\u00dfen wie im Kleinen Ma\u00dfstab \u2013 angegangen werden k\u00f6nnen: Unter anderem durch ausf\u00fchrliche Informationsbeschaffung, den Aufbau von Kontakten, gute Kommunikation und das Aufbauen von Allianzen. W\u00e4hrenddessen wird klar werden, dass man f\u00fcr erfolgreichen politischen Aktivismus kein Hauptzeitlobbyist sein muss, sondern Vielf\u00e4ltigkeit sogar von Vorteil ist.\r\n\r\nBildcredit: Konrad Twardowski,CC BY-SA 2.0",

Instead of trying to fix our CPUs by reverse-engineering large amounts of proprietary blobbiness, I propose we move as much sensitive data as possible out of these compromised systems.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the architecture I propose places a trusted interposer into the compromised system's display bus (LVDS, (e)DP or HDMI) that receives in-band control data containing intact ciphertext (read: PGP/OTR encoded into specially formatted RGB pixel data) and that transparently decrypts, verifies and renders the decrypted data into the pixel data stream.\r\n\r\nThe resulting system looks almost identical from a user-interface perspective, but guarantees plaintext message data is never handled on the compromised host CPU while all the juicy computational power and fancy visual effects that one provides remain intact.\r\n\r\nI will outline the implementation problem areas of this approach and some possible solutions for them.

One of the main findings is that space and CPU cycles are precious - the developers spent a significant effort to keep resource usage low.\r\nWith increasing understanding of the inner structure of the game, we developed a map editor in Python which we will open source after the presentation.

                                "description": "The tablet PC contains a similar watermarking mechanism that can be used to track and prevent the distribution of unwanted media files in a more advanced and effective way. In addition, Woolim contains a remarkable hardening and jails the user to protect the integrity of the system. The tablet itself and the Apps that are preinstalled provide a rare insight into DPRK\u2019s development in the IT sector. We will lift the fog on the internals of Woolim and provide a deep dive into the internals of the tablet PC.\r\n\r\nOver the past years DPRK released several different tablet PCs. This talk will focus on what seems to be the latest device called Woolim (\uc6b8\ub9bc), which is the Korean word for \u201eecho\u201c. It was build in late 2015 and the device is an outstanding piece of technology designed to jail users to predefined functionality and track the user's behavior.\r\n\r\nWe will start by giving an introduction to the hardware specifications of the tablet. The device is equipped with a wide variety of applications. Users are able to read and create documents, watch movies, visit websites and play games. There are also a bunch of dictionaries on the device. We will give an introduction to the most interesting applications and features of the tablet.\r\n\r\nThe applications that come with Woolim give a rare insight into how technology is used and distributed in DPRK. All of the applications on Woolim have been touched by DPRK, even games like Angry Birds have been modified. The features implemented to jail the user and protect the integrity of the system will also be in focus for this talk.\r\n\r\nWe have published a detailed analysis of a watermarking mechanism in DPRK\u2019s Red Star OS last year, speculating that the code in Red Star OS already contains some preparations for a far more sophisticated watermarking mechanism. We have identified such advanced mechanisms in Woolim and will give a technical insight on how they prevent distribution of unwanted media more effectively.\r\n\r\nDPRK continues to develop surveillance technology that is hidden inside consumer hardware. It\u2019s goal seems to be to enable total control of it\u2019s users in terms of tracking the distribution of media files and preventing unwanted information in the DPRK ecosystem. Implementing such features into smartphones or tablet PCs like Woolim allows even more effective surveillance of DPRK citizens. Therefore, we will try to shed some light on the privacy invading features of Woolim.",

Although secure coding practices are used when developing in PHP, they can\u2019t mitigate vulnerabilities in the language itself. Since PHP is written in C, it is exposed to vulnerabilities found in projects written in a low-level language, such as memory-corruption vulnerabilities, which are common when manipulating data formats. PHP-7 is a new implementation of the language, and while memory corruption bugs exist in this version as well, none of the exploitation primitives from the previous version are working (e.g. @i0n1c presentation from BH2010). \r\nIn this talk, I will discuss the memory internals of PHP7 from exploiter and vulnerability researcher's perspective, explain newly found vulnerabilities in the unserialize mechanism and demonstrate how to exploit this class of bugs in PHP-7 presenting re-usable primitives.\r\nThe internals of the language implementation changed quite dramatically, and now it\u2019s harder to find and exploit memory corruption bugs. The new zval system prefers embedding over pointing to members and the allocation mechanism has gone through a complete re-write, removing metadata. The overall result is less primitives and less control over crafted data. unserialize is a data manipulation and object instantiation mechanism in PHP which is prone to memory corruption vulnerabilities.  For the first time, we have managed to implement a remote exploit of a real world bug in PHP-7unserialize mechanism.",

This is confirmed by predicting randomly generated group keys on several platforms. We then examine whether group keys are securely transmitted to clients. Here we discover a downgrade attack that forces usage of RC4 to encrypt the group key when transmitted in the 4-way handshake. The per-message RC4 key is the concatenation of a public 16-byte initialization vector with a secret 16-byte key, and the first 256 keystream bytes are dropped. We study this peculiar usage of RC4, and find that capturing 2 billion handshakes can be sufficient to recover (i.e., decrypt) a 128-bit group key. We also examine whether group traffic is properly isolated from unicast traffic. We find that this is not the case, and show that the group key can be used to inject and decrypt unicast traffic. Finally, we propose and study a new random number generator tailored for 802.11 platforms.",

I gathered this collection of historical and anthropological notes, so that together with school kids we can think about how the very idea of privacy was developed in different countries and in different historical epochs. In ancient Babylon wealthy women were allowed to cover their faces and their bodies, but the poor ones were not. In the Soviet Union during Stalin times it was dangerous to tell a political joke even in the group of close friends. One of them may report a joke to the authorities. Punishment for a political joke could be a prison sentence. \r\nToday more or less all our online communication is watched or recorded by authorities.\r\nHow does our present relate to other times in history, how is the western notion of privacy related to the ideas in other cultures.",

Stories stick because they make us feel something; and we remember situations in which we felt intense feelings. Stories make us act; they change our beliefs. Stories make us feel warm and empathic and alive. Data doesn't make us feel anything on it\u2019s own. Data is cold.\r\n\r\nAnd still, I love data, and I love to work with it. Can we create feelings with data? Away from the beaten paths of company dashboards, scientific plots and newspaper graphics? I believe it's possible. In my talk, I will showcase some ways to present data so that it sticks and makes you feel things. We'll talk about the status quo of data presentation and where we still need to go. If you like data and want to look at more of it, you should come by. ",

Wir geben einen umfassenden R\u00fcckblick auf das ereignissreiche Jahr 2016, in dem die Schweizer Bev\u00f6lkerung \u00fcber gleich zwei Massen\u00fcberwachungsgesetze entschieden hat. Die netzpolitischen Gruppierungen haben mit viel Einsatz gegen die Gesetze gek\u00e4mpft . Wir berichten dar\u00fcber, wie wir das angengangen sind, wie es ausgegangen ist und was wir dabei gelernt haben.\r\nZudem machen wir einen Ausblick auf kommende netzpolitische Herausforderungen.",
                                "description": "In Sachen Netzpolitik hat sich im Jahr 2016, seit unserem letzten Vortrag zu dem Thema, viel getan.\r\n\r\nGleich zu Beginn 2016 kam die Nachricht, dass das Referendum zum NDG erfolgreich war. Damit hat das Schweizer Stimmvolk die Chance erhalten, \u00fcber das Geheimdienstgesetz (NDG) abzustimmen. Mit dem Zustandekommen des Referendums war aber erst die halbe Arbeit getan. \r\n\r\nEs galt nun der in Gang gesetzten staatlichen Propagandamaschinerie sowie einigen, insbesondere b\u00fcrgerlichen, Parteien entgegenzuwirken. Die netzpolitischen Gruppierungen waren also gefragt, sich aktiv, parteipolitisch unabh\u00e4ngig und mit technischen Fakten in den Abstimmungskampf einzubringen. Am 25. September 2016 hat dann das Schweizer Stimmvolk \u00fcber das neue Nachrichtendienstgesetz entschieden: 65% der Bev\u00f6lkerung hat das gesetz angenommen, nur gerade 35 % teilten unsere Meinung.\r\n\r\nIm Fr\u00fchling hat das Parlament gleich das n\u00e4chste fragw\u00fcrdige Gesetz verabschiedet - das revidierte Bundesgesetz betreffend die \u00dcberwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (B\u00dcPF). Auch gegen dieses Gesetz hat die Schweizer Netzgemeinde, unterst\u00fctzt von einer ganzen Reihe Jungparteien, umgehend das Referendum ergriffen. Das Sammeln der Unterschriften wurde diesmal aus den R\u00e4umen des CCC Z\u00fcrich (CCCZH) koordiniert, da es sich abgesehen von der stark netzpolitisch verankerten Pirtatenpartei, nicht um eine parteipolitische Initiative handelte. Auch wenn das Referendum gegen das B\u00dcPF leider nicht erfolgreich war, so haben wir bei der Zusammenarbeit mit einem gross gestreuten Kommittee, beim Sammeln auf der Strasse und dem Ausz\u00e4hlen und bescheinigen der Unterschriften viel gelernt und somit nicht Gold, aber immerhin Silber und Bronze abger\u00e4umt.\r\n\r\nAuch wenn mit 2016 ein - mit Bezug auf die Schweizer Netzpolitik - besonders d\u00fcsters Jahr zu Ende geht, so ist f\u00fcr die Zukunft noch einiges ausstehend. Zum Schluss wollen wir einen kurzen \u00dcberblick geben \u00fcber das was kommt.\r\n\r\nDetaillierte Erkl\u00e4rungen zum politischen System in der Schweiz und der (damals) aktuellen Lage haben wir im Vortrag am 32c3 gegeben: https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7205-netzpolitik_in_der_schweiz\r\n\r\nIm Anschluss an den Talk gibt es eine ausgedehnte Diskussions- und Fragesession zu den behandelten Themen im Raum A.1: Siehe hier: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Session:Netzpolitik_in_der_Schweiz_2017",

Der AKVorrat zeigt in einem netzpolitischen Jahresr\u00fcckblick, was wir dagegen tun k\u00f6nnen und zeigt, dass Zivilgesellschaft wirkt. ",
                                "description": "Polizeiliches Staatsschutzgesetz beschlossen, Gesetzesvorlage f\u00fcr die Legalisierung einer \u00dcberwachungssoftware (Bundestrojaner) eingebracht, weitreichende \u00dcberwachungsma\u00dfnahmen neuerdings schon bei Verwaltungs\u00fcbertretungen m\u00f6glich etc. \u2013 die Liste der datenschutzrechtlichen und netzpolitischen Problemf\u00e4lle in \u00d6sterreich ist lang. Das Arbeitspensum f\u00fcr Aktivistinnen und Aktivisten in \u00d6sterreich steigt.\r\n\r\nAuch f\u00fcr zivilgesellschaftliche Initiativen gilt, dass Politik das Bohren harter Bretter bedeutet. Mit einer wohldosierten Mischung aus juristischer und technischer Expertise sowie Aktionismus konnten 2016 ein paar sehr tiefe L\u00f6cher in die offizielle unausgewogene Netzpolitik \u00d6sterreichs gebohrt werden. \r\n\r\nHerzst\u00fcck der Aktivit\u00e4ten des abgelaufenen Jahres war HEAT, das Handbuch zur Evaluation der Anti-Terror-Gesetze in \u00d6sterreich. \r\n\r\nDas Ausma\u00df der staatlichen Eingriffe in unsere Privatsph\u00e4re und in die informationelle Selbstbestimmung l\u00e4sst sich nur durch die Betrachtung der Summe aller Eingriffe richtig erfassen. Diese wichtige Erkenntnis der Notwendigkeit einer \u201e\u00dcberwachungs-Gesamtrechnung\u201c wurde erstmals vom deutschen Bundesverfassungsgericht im Urteil zur Aufhebung der deutschen Vorratsdatenspeicherung im M\u00e4rz 2010 formuliert. HEAT listet alle \u00dcberwachungsgesetze \u00d6sterreichs auf, kombiniert dies mit einer Aufarbeitung der relevanten Judikatur, einer Erhebung der f\u00fcr Sicherheitsbeh\u00f6rden verf\u00fcgbaren sowie der tats\u00e4chlich eingesetzten Technologien und schlie\u00dflich einer ersten groben Technikfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung. In den Schlussfolgerungen wird daraus ein Kriterienkatalog f\u00fcr eine Evaluation aller Anti-Terror-Gesetze abgeleitet. Dieses \u201ePflichtenheft\u201c soll staatlichen und zivilen Organisationen helfen, \u00fcberschie\u00dfende und damit potentiell verfassungswidrige \u00dcberwachungsbefugnisse zu identifizieren. Mit HEAT liegt erstmals eine Anleitung vor, wie bestehende und zuk\u00fcnftige Gesetze mit allgemein anerkannten Grundrechten in Einklang gebracht werden k\u00f6nnen. Diese ist allgemein anwendbar und nicht nur f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich.\r\n\r\nHEAT ist auch die Grundlage f\u00fcr eine sogenannte Drittelbeschwerde, die von einem Drittel der Abgeordneten zum \u00f6sterreichischen Nationalrat gegen das Polizeiliche Staatsschutzgesetz beim \u00d6sterreichischen Verfassungsgerichtshof eingebracht wurde.",

Over the past two years,\r\nthis group's activity increased significantly, in particular with numerous attacks against foreign affairs ministries and embassies all over the world. They are supposedly behind the DNC hack, and the WADA hack, which happened earlier this year. This talk presents the results of a two-year hunt after Sednit, during which we dug up and analyzed many of their software.\r\n\r\n",

Not only have they created a complex software ecosystem -- composed of tens of different components --, but they also regularly come out with 0-day exploits. Also remarkable is their ability to very quickly integrate newly published techniques in their toolkit.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we will explain how they tend to operate and we will dive into technical details of their most impressive components:\r\n\r\n- DOWNDELPH, a mysterious downloader deployed in very rare cases and with advanced persistence methods. In particular, we found a Windows bootkit dropping this component, and also a Windows rootkit, both never documented.\r\n\r\n    - XTUNNEL, a network proxy tool able to transform an infected machine into a pivot to contact computers normally unreachable from the Internet. Heavily obfuscated, and based on a custom encrypted protocol, XTUNNEL is a major asset in Sednit post-infection toolkit.\r\n\r\n    - XAGENT, the flagship Sednit backdoor, for which Windows, Linux and iOS versions have been developed. Built as a modular framework around a so-called \"kernel\", it allows to build flexible backdoors with, for example, the ability to switch between various network protocols.\r\n\r\n    - SEDKIT, a full-fledged exploit-kit, which depending on the target's configuration may drop 0-day exploits or revamped exploits.\r\n\r\n    And also, during our tracking, we also gained a great visibility on Sednit post-infection modus operandi, a world full of Mimikatz and various custom hacking tools.",

Eins, dass mit Licht Dinge sehen kann unterhalb der Beugungsgrenze von Licht, in mehreren Farben, in 3D. Das Ding ist fertig \u2013 so fertig wie etwas sein kann, das man als Doktorarbeitsprojekt bezeichnet. Ich will das niemandem verkaufen, die Forschung ist Ver\u00f6ffentlicht, unsere Software dazu ist open source. F\u00fcr mich war die Arbeit daran Eintrittskarte in eine andere Welt. Ich will erz\u00e4hlen was Hochaufl\u00f6sungsmikroskopie ist, die drei verschiedenen Ans\u00e4tze dazu (PALM/STORM, STED, SIM), wie sie sich erg\u00e4nzen und wie die technologische Entwicklung des 21. Jahrhunderts das erst m\u00f6glich gemacht hat. Wie Techniken basierend auf Laserphysik (STED), stochastischem Blinken von Molek\u00fclen (PALM/STORM) oder schneller Fouriertransformation (SIM) uns erm\u00f6glichen tiefer in Zellen hinein zu schauen \u2013 und man sich pl\u00f6tzlich Gedanken dar\u00fcber machen muss wie man etwas in einem Bild darstellt, dass eigentlich gar kein richtiges Bild ist, sondern ein vielschichtiges Messergebnis. Aber auch die Community in diesem Feld ist interessant. Langsam aber sicher verbreitet sich der open science Gedanke, immer mehr Software ist Quelloffen, es gibt sogar einen J\u00e4hrlichen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr die beste Bildrekonstruktionssoftware, immer mehr Anleitungen zum Eigenbau machen die Runde, wie zum Beispiel Arduino L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr Kameratimings, Laser aus Discobeleuchtungen und hier und da finden sich auch offene Daten. Trotzdem werden Mikroskope wohl nie dem Teleskop den Rang ablaufen, denn das was man als interessierter Bastler, oder auch als Profi auf diesem Gebiet, zu Hause anstellen kann ist begrenzt. Was geht will ich auf der B\u00fchne zeigen mit kosteng\u00fcnstigen USB-Mikroskopen und evtl. mit einem kleinen Eigenbau.",

We saw the potential, we saw it coming.

Now, the Internet governs our lives.\r\n\r\nSuccess always comes with strings attached. \r\n\r\nThe Internet morphed with us. Once an unexplored space we were wandering in solitude, now it has become a marketplace for goods, *the* vehicle for communication, as well as an instrument for control, and a field for battle.\r\n\r\nWe learned the many ways it was abused and broken.

Solche Positionen beruhen nicht auf einer nachvollziehbaren Argumentation, sondern auf sprachlich-rhetorischen Tricks, die im Grunde leicht zu durchschauen sind, denen jedoch immer mehr Menschen auf den Leim gehen.

Statt diese Positionen argumentativ zu untermauern, was oft gar nicht m\u00f6glich oder zumindest wenig \u00fcberzeugend ist, wird oft mit Stereotypisierungen und Scheinargumenten gearbeitet. Oft verweisen Populisten auf das \"Recht des St\u00e4rkeren\" (der Mehrheit) und stellen das als \"demokratisch\" dar, obwohl der Minderheitenschutz ein wesentliches Merkmal demokratischer Systeme ist. Gleichzeitig wird eine Minderheit zum S\u00fcndenbock gemacht. Eine populistische Forderung wird sprachlich oft auf eine einfache Formel gebracht (\"Obergrenze\", \"Kinder statt Inder\", \"Fl\u00fcchtlingswelle\", \"Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen\" usw.), wobei oft mit bestimmten Tricks gearbeitet wird, z.B. mit Unterstellungen (genauer: Pr\u00e4suppositionen bzw. Implikaturen) und framing (Einordnung in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen, m\u00f6glicherweise unpassenden Zusammenhang). Sich auf populistische Scheinargumentationen einzulassen, ist gef\u00e4hrlich, weil damit oft unbewusst unhaltbare Positionen, auf denen die Argumentation beruht (z.B. ein bestimmtes framing), hingenommen und nicht mehr hinterfragt werden.

No, they\u2019ll target our scarily insecure mobile devices and computers. How did we get here, what's going on, and what can we do to stop it? Come to this talk to find out.\r\n\r\nFor more than fifteen years, the FBI has had a dedicated hacking team. Until recently, this team\u2019s hacking operations were shrouded in near-complete secrecy. That is slowly starting to change. And while we still don\u2019t know a lot, what we have learned is alarming. For example, in order to deliver malware, the FBI has impersonated journalists and engaged in bulk-hacking operations that targeted users of legitimate communications services (TorMail).\r\n\r\nAs the next crypto wars unfold in Washington, London and Brussels, we should expect to see law enforcement hacking play a central role in the debate. With the mass, default adoption of full disk encryption storage and end-to-end encryption for communications, law enforcement agencies will no doubt struggle to acquire data that has traditionally been easy for them to get. This will likely result in two significant policy shifts \u2013 first, it will force law enforcement hacking out of the shadows, and second, it will cause hacking tools to trickle down from elite, well-resourced federal law enforcement units to regional and local cops, who are most impacted by encryption, the least technically sophisticated and the most likely to abuse hacking tools.\r\n\r\nIf a world in which the FBI hacks is scary, just wait until local police departments are doing it too.\r\n\r\nWe must stop the spread of hacking as a law enforcement tool, before it is too late.",

Militante Vigilanten organisieren den v\u00f6lkischen \u201eSelbstschutz\u201c gegen Zuwanderung und staatliche Stellen sehen allzuoft augenzwinkernd zu. Erst als ein \u201eReichsb\u00fcrger\u201c Mitte Oktober einen Polizisten erschie\u00dft, beginnt der Apparat \u2013 auch gegen die \u201eReichsb\u00fcrger\u201c in den eigenen Reihen \u2013 zu ermitteln.

Rather than taking a position in this debate, we are asking how the two have been co-articulated in talks so far by CCC participants?  In order to answer this question, we are analysing the available titles and abstracts of Congress talks from 1984 until now.  This ongoing research seeks to identify changing trends, significant outliers, apparent patterns and common threads throughout the years.  We also wonder if it is possible to identify turning points in the narrative.  The empirical data is contextualised by reflections on the shifting ground of technology, politics and society in the world during the long history of the CCC, as well as by qualitative reflections of attendants.  We are inviting the audience to help us with the latter by joining in a follow-up discussion after the presentation.",

Over time, upper strata compress the lower ones into permanent records of the history of our planet's surface. Because chemical signals such as gas bubbles, isotopes, etc. are captured in the strata, scientists can analyse the geochemistry of the past, date certain events, and more. That kind of data ultimately underlies <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1732/\" title=\"xkcd comic &#39;Earth Temperature Timeline&#39;\">xkcd's recent 'Earth Temperature Timeline'</a>. Direct measurements of geochemical signals such as <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/\" title=\"Keeling curve of CO2 concentrations\">atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration</a> and ocean pH has started in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\r\n<p>Besides the <a href=\"https://ipcc.ch/\" title=\"Website of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, the AWG is possibly the scientific committee with most public attention currently. It is composed of (specialised) geologists (Duh!), archaeologists, geographers, anthropologists, political and climate scientists, and others. Therefore, formalising the Anthropocene definition is a multi-disciplinary, collaborative scientific effort, as well as an inherently political statement. This talk will explain why.</p>\r\n",

The IT-Security industry is selling a range of products with often very questionable and sometimes outright ridiculous claims. Yet it's widely accepted practice among users and companies that protection with security appliances, antivirus products and firewalls is a necessity. There are no rigorous scientific studies that try to evaluate the effectiveness of most security products or strategies. Evidence-based IT security could provide a way out of the security nihilism that's often dominating the debate \u2013 however it doesn't exist yet.",
                                "description": "From Next-Generation APT-Defense to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: The promises of IT security product vendors are often bold. Some marketing promises are simply impossible, because they violate a fundamental theorem of computer science, the halting problem.\r\n\r\nMany IT security professionals are skeptical of security appliances, antivirus software and other IT security products and call them snake oil. Furthermore security products often have security vulnerabilities themselves, which has lately been shown by the impressive work done by Tavis Ormandy from Google's Project Zero.\r\n\r\nWhen there's disagreement about the effectiveness of an approach then rational people should ask for scientific evidence. However, surprisingly this evidence largely doesn't exist. While there obviously is a lot of scientific research in IT security it rarely tries to answer practical questions most relevant to users. Decisions are made in an ad-hoc way and are usually based on opinions rather than rigorous scientific evidence. It is quite ironic that given the medical analogies this field likes to use (viruses, infections etc.), nobody is looking how medicine solves these problems.\r\n\r\nThe gold standard of scientific evidence in medicine (and many other fields) is to do randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of those trials. An RCT divides patients in groups and a treatment \u2013 for example a new drug \u2013 is compared against a placebo treatment or against the current best practice. Single trials are usually not considered sufficient, therefore meta-analyses pool together the results of all trials done on a particular question. There's no reason RCTs couldn't be applied to the question whether a particular security product works.\r\n\r\nEvidence-based medicine is undoubtedly the right approach, but these methods aren't without problems. Publication Bias skews results, many studies cannot be replicated and the scientific publishing and career system is often supporting poor scientific practices. But this doesn't question the scientific approach itself, it just means that more rigorous scientific practices need to be implemented.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the few cases where controlled studies are done in the Infosec world they often suffer from the most basic methodological problems like being underpowered (too few participants), never being independently replicated or not measuring relevant outcomes. (There are a few studies on password security and similar questions.)\r\n\r\nApplying rigorous science to IT security could provide a way out of the security nihilism that dominates the debate so often these days - \u201cEverything is broken, everyone's going to get hacked eventually\u201d. And by learning from other fields Evidence-Based IT Security could skip the flaws that rife other fields of science.",

Ausserdem wird die Funktionsweise von Light-clients behandelt. Dabei spielen insbesondere der Aufbau der Bitcoin Bl\u00f6cke und der Schutz der Transaktionen mittels eines Merkle Baumes eine wichtige Rolle.\r\n\r\nDer Vortrag fokussiert auf die Blockchain-Technologie. Funktionen und Implementationsdetails von Bitcoin, die mit der Blockchain nicht in direktem Zusammenhang stehen, werden nicht behandelt. Es werden die Eigenschaften \u00f6ffentlicher, POW basierter, Blockchains behandelt, private Blockchains, wie sie in von Finanzinstituten entwickelt werden, werden nicht behandelt.",

The entire US secret service apparatus was looking for the American Whistleblower. Every policeman in Hong Kong was on the lookout. And hundreds of journalists were flooding the city to find the man who shocked the world. \r\nNo one could find him. On June 23, Snowden boarded a plane to Moscow. In the two weeks before that, he had simply been invisible.\r\nFor three years, these two weeks have been unexplained. Then, investigative journalist S\u00f6nke Iwersen from the German newspaper Handelsblatt filled in the gaps.\r\nToday, S\u00f6nke will present the people who kept Snowden alive: rights lawyer Robert Tibbo, who is coming from Hong Kong to Hamburg to join us on stage. Ajith, a former soldier from Sri Lanka. Vanessa, a domestic helper from the Philippines. And Nadeeka and Supun, a refugee couple in Hong Kong.\r\nWithout any preparations, these five men and women were given an almost impossible task: Hide the most wanted man alive. This hour at 33c3 will tell how they succeeded. You will learn about Snowden\u2019s days in hiding, the human rights situation for refugees in Hong Kong, and how you can help both Snowden and the refugees who saved his life. Also, you will hear the latest news on Edward Snowden himself. Lena Rohrbach from Amnesty International will tell you about the Pardon Snowden Campaign and how you can participate.

Ihr werdet Spiegel-Online danach mit anderen Augen lesen.\r\n\r\nDazu gibt er einen <i>allgemeinverst\u00e4ndlichen</i> \u00dcberblick, was mit der heutigen Daten-Auswerterei alles geht. Ihr werdet also vielleicht auch mehr aufpassen, was f\u00fcr Daten von euch ihr ins Internet lasst.\r\n\r\nDer Vortrag hat drei rote F\u00e4den:\r\n\r\n<b>1) Wir reverse engineeren Spiegel-Online.</b> Wir nehmen den Datensatz so richtig auseinander und betrachten Spiegel-Online aus vielen v\u00f6llig neuen Blickwinkeln. Das Ganze wird bunt, unterhaltsam und anschaulich passieren, so dass es f\u00fcr Techies und Nicht-Techies eing\u00e4ngig ist. Warum sind manche Artikel lang, manche kurz? Kann man Artikeln ansehen, ob die Redakteure wirklich dahinter stehen oder nicht? Welche Redakteure sind enger miteinander verbandelt als andere? Welche Inhalte h\u00e4lt der Spiegel selbst f\u00fcr politisch inkorrekt? \r\n\r\nKann man sowas <i>wirklich</i> einfach so von au\u00dfen messen? Glaubt\u2019s mal \u2013 man kann. Bei einigen der Auswertungen wird vielleicht \u201enur\u201c das rauskommen, was ihr euch schon vorher denken konntet. Bei anderen werden wir \u00fcberraschende Ergebnisse erhalten. Und manchmal entdeckt man auch Systematiken da, wo man \u00fcberhaupt keine erwartet hat. Kurz: Wir werden kreativ sein. Wir werden etwas lernen und Spiegel-Online auch. \r\n\r\n<b>2) Ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber \u201eData Science\u201c.</b> Wir betrachten nicht nur die Vorgehensweise, sondern auch die M\u00f6glichkeiten und gesellschaftlichen Gefahren der Datensammelwut und Auswerterei. \u00dcber den Vortrag hinweg wird David \u2013 locker und unmathematisch \u2013 verschiedene Methoden des Datenauswertens anhand des Spiegel-Online-Datensatzes anschaulich machen. Nicht mit Formeln, sondern mit bunten Grafiken. Nach dem Vortrag werdet ihr eine Vorstellung davon haben, was sich hinter dem \u201eBig Data\u201c-Buzzword verbirgt, und warum dieser Hype \u2013 bei allem Nutzen, den er haben mag \u2013 gesellschaftlich auch sehr gef\u00e4hrlich ist. Ihr k\u00f6nnt n\u00e4mlich \u00fcberhaupt nicht wissen was ihr \u00fcber euch preisgebt, wenn ihr irgendwelche Daten ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Egal, wie uninteressant eure Daten f\u00fcr euch aussehen m\u00f6gen \u2013 was man daraus lesen kann, entscheidet der Gegner und nicht ihr. \r\n\r\n<b>3) Und f\u00fcr die Aktivisten unter euch</b> liefert der Vortrag eine grobe Anleitung, wie man es sinnvoll anstellt, wenn man ein Massenmedium (oder auch beliebige andere Sachen im Internet) mal beobachten und so richtig durchleuchten will. Wie sammeln wir die Daten? Wie geht man kreativ mit Daten um? Wie findet man Zusammenh\u00e4nge? Wie gie\u00dft man die Daten in sinnvolle und \u00e4sthetische Bilder, mit denen jeder etwas anfangen kann? Es gibt ja nur eine Breitband-Verbindung ins Gehirn: die Augen.",

                                "description": "Despite its ubiquitous application and widespread acceptance, mobile instant messaging remains a complex matter and is often not understood by its users. Easy-to-use apps and security assurances by their developers suggest users a safe and private environment for conversation. At the same time, more and more apps flood the market and it is becoming increasingly difficult, even for technically-educated users, to keep track of both technological development and their own security and privacy requirements. We want to present a talk that sheds some light into technical aspects of mobile instant messaging and presents an overview of techniques and design decisions by different mobile instant messaging app developers. We aim at both technically-educated and casual users alike, trying to present simple analogies and break down complex details into understandable components. After an introduction to the mobile instant messaging world, we will dissect one of the most popular mobile instant messaging apps in Germany: Threema. It is closed-source and only superficially documented, yet widely used. We picked it for a particular design decision in its protocol, the lack of which we consider the most important flaw in competitor protocols like Signal: the use of discardable IDs in favor of phone numbers. Another interesting aspect about Threema\u2019s protocol is its use of the NaCl library for end-to-end encryption. We have fully reverse-engineered the Threema app and can therefore analyze and present its protocol and our analysis of it in detail.",

                                "description": "USB is amazing.  It's hot-pluggable, auto-negotiating, and reasonably fast.  It's robust, capable of supplying power, and works cross-platform.  It lives up to the \u201cUniversal\u201d claim: your PC definitely has USB, but it may not have TTL Serial, I2C, or SPI available.  Hardware USB support is available in all manner of embedded microcontrollers.  However it's not available on all microcontrollers, and integrating a hardware USB PHY can double the cost of a low-end microcontroller.   This problem is particularly acute in the sub-$1 microcontrollers: a companion USB PHY chip would typically cost more than the microcontroller (example: the MAX3420E USB-to-SPI adapter costs around $5), so your only option for USB is to get your hands dirty and bit bang the missing protocol.\r\n\r\nThis talk describes the implementation of a new bitbanged USB stack, starting with a primer on the USB PHY layer and continuing up the stack, concluding with \"Palawan\", a feature-complete open-source bitbanged USB Low Speed stack available for use on microcontrollers priced for under a dollar.  We'll go over requirements for getting USB to work, as well as talking about USB timing, packet order, and how to integrate everything together.\r\n\r\nUnlike other bitbang USB implementations such as V-USB and LemcUSB, Palawan makes fewer assumptions about GPIO layout.  With Palawan, USB's D+ and D- signals can be on different GPIO banks, and need not be consecutive.  By doing so, more pins are available to the user, making it easier to use with devices that have special restrictions on what pins can do what.  The only requirements are that both GPIO pins can be both inputs and push-pull outputs, and that at least one pin can be used as an interrupt.\r\n\r\n Palawan also includes a USB HID firmware update mechanism to allow for updates to be installed even on platforms that normally require USB drivers.\r\n\r\nAs a protocol, USB comes in multiple speeds.  The base speeds are called Full Speed and Low Speed -- FS and LS respectively.  FS runs at 12 Mbps, and LS runs at 1.5 Mbps.  LS is more restricted in scope than FS.  It limits packet data payload size to 8 bytes (down from 64), and only allows Control or Interrupt endpoints (so no Bulk or Isochronous endpoints).  While it's true that this limits the total possible features we can implement, it means that the job of implementing them in software becomes simpler.  Limiting communications to 8-bytes of payload data also significantly lowers memory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe core USB PHY layer consists of two functions: USBPhyRead() and USBPhyWrite().  These functions transparently take care of bit stuffing and unstuffing, where long runs of data have a transition period inserted.  They also take care of synchronizing reception to the incoming signal, as well as interpreting SE0 end sequences, recognizing USB keepalive packets, and adding the USB SE0 footer.  This particular implementation takes care to ensure incoming packets are presented in the correct endianness, as USB packets are transmitted with the most significant byte first.\r\n\r\nSince the PHY code is written using cycle-counting, it must be run from memory that is cycle-accurate.  The Kinetis parts we used for testing have variable-cycle flash, so we must first copy the data into RAM and execute from there.  Fortunately, gcc makes it easy to put executable code in the .data section, and automatically generates calls to RAM.\r\n\r\nThe core of the USB PHY layer is written in Thumb2 assembly for an ARM Cortex M0+ using ARMv6m.  This is an extremely limited subset of ARM code that removes lots of fun stuff like conditional execution, different source and destination registers in opcodes, as well as DSP instructions.  As a tradeoff, most instructions complete in one cycle, with the notable exceptions of branches (which are two cycles if taken) and loads/stores (which are two cycles unless it involves single-cycle IO).  USB is 1.5 Mbit/s, and at 48 MHz that gives us 32 cycles to write the data out two ports, calculate bit [un]stuffing, check for end-of-packet, and load the next chunk of data for writing.\r\n\r\nThe the USB PHY layer makes the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n  +\t The controller is a 48 MHz Cortex M0+ with associated two-stage pipeline\r\n  +\t GPIO is single-cycle access (sometimes referred to as Fast GPIO or FGPIO)\r\n  +\t GPIO has separate \"Set Value\" and \"Clear Value\" banks.\r\n  +\t GPIO pin direction register is 1 for output, 0 for input\r\n  +\t Code is executing from single-cycle access memory, meaning it may need to execute from RAM\r\n\r\nDespite these limitations, this code has been ported to two different Freescale/NXP Kinetis parts under a variety of operating systems.  These assumptions aren't terribly restrictive, meaning this core could easily be ported to other M0+ implementations.\r\n\r\nOther bit-banged USB implementations make assumptions that were not useful for our implementation.  V-USB impressively works on an AVR microcontroller across a range of frequencies, but it is the wrong architecture and uses special timer modes unavailable on ARM.  LemcUSB is conceptually similar to Palawan and is available for other M0+ chips, and in fact can run at a lower clock speed of 24 MHz.  However, LemcUSB requires that D+ and D- be on a GPIO bank's pins 0 and 1 respectively, which is not available on all chips, or may conflict with the SWD pins.  Additionally, the M0+ ISA has no instruction for reversing word order, so LemcUSB's low-level PHY functions return data reversed.  Palawan takes care to load bits in the correct order, saving a step when examining the packet.\r\n\r\nOur sample implementation is accompanied by a bootloader that provides a USB HID communication. This allows for driver-free firmware updates even on Windows, which normally requires a signed driver installation.  This USB HID code can act as a keyboard, but is also bidirectional, and is capable of allowing for firmware upload to the device.  While there are bootloader HID implementations from companies such as NXP and Microchip, we are unaware of any general-purpose open-source USB HID bootloader created with the intention of providing firmware updates.",

Also, many of these users are always logged in at some web sites of these companies. For web sites by other parties, it seems convenient to just re-use this already established authentication: They do not need to annoy the user with registration and login, and these web sites also do not need to maintain and protect an authentication database on their own. This is where SSO protocols come into play -- most times OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect. Both protocols have in common that they even require that the identity providers track where users log in. The only attempt so far, that tried to do better to protect the user's privacy, is Mozilla's BrowserID (a.k.a. Persona).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have analyzed these SSO protocols and discovered various critical attacks that break the security of all three protocols and also break the privacy promise of BrowserID.

This devolution is seen through the lens of the changing nature of conflict through digitalization, the collapse of the nation state in Iraq and Syria, and the future of war. ",
                                "description": "In the popular video game series \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\", Arab men are consistently depicted as the mindless throngs of the indestinguishable enemy. The First Person Shooter (FPS) genre lends itself to killing enemies, usually many in the same round, but the evolution of the target went from Nazi's in Wolfenstein 3D in 1992, to targets that become increasingly comparable to Arabs and Muslims in the following years. So besides historically oriented games that focus on the combatants of World War II, most games since the 1990's begin to shift their focus to another kind of enemy--one that suspiciously looks Arab or Islamic. Even Sci-Fi epics like the Halo series, which take place may hundreds of years in the future, the enemies start taking on an exotified look and feel, and follow an obviously religious ideology that is inimical to universal peace. The smallest insignificant alien becomes a strategic risk as they become \"suicide bombers\" blowing themselves up before they die, expressing a sigh of cowardice before they die. \r\n\r\nIn \"Modern Warfare 2\", something suprising happens. The Arab characters are given a little more depth and backstory, and the Arabic dialogue is the most realistic of any of the other games. It also becomes the version of the game that is most modified by users (in so-called \"mods\"). Hacked and converted to other versions, there is significantly a version used by Al-Qaeda for recruitment purposes. The production company responsible, Infinity Ward, later had its two chief developers and founders fired under mysterious circumstances. \r\n\r\nAs a researcher on radical Islamic thought, over the years I have collected some materials about video games and their uses for recruitment and ideological training on the Jihadist side. What I would like to do for 33C3 is show versions of the modded games parrallel to the originals in a face-off setting, and give a lecture about the background to these games. I will explore stories of recruitment from American soldiers, and how these games factored into their decision to join the U.S. military. Through the digital realm, I will propose a new framework for understanding the so-called Huntingtonian \"Clash of Civilizations\"--where very recent cultural artifacts become automatic motivations. As a drone operator sees the pixelation of a real Arab male on the screen, it is an image he's shot at in the virtual domain over and over again since he was a child.  The Arab male has devolved from being a human being (in the way that women or children, or caucasian males are) to being mere fodder, a natural target where you simply just shoot. ",

                                "description": "Randomness is a fundamental, security-critical resource in the wider security ecosystem utilized by everything from cryptographic software (eg. key and nonce generation) to exploit mitigations (eg. ASLR and stack canary generation). Ideally secure random number generation is done using a dedicated hardware True Random Number Generator (TRNG) collecting entropy from physical processes such as radioactive decay or shot noise. TRNGs, however, are both relatively slow in their provision of random data and often too expensive to integrate in a system which means computer systems have to resort to a software (cryptographically secure) Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). Such a CSPRNG is seeded (both initially and continuously) from a variety of sources of 'true' entropy which are effectively stretched into additional pseudo-random data using cryptographic methods. Since the design and implementation of such CSPRNGs is a complicated and involved effort, many operating systems provide one as a system service (eg. /dev/(u)random on UNIX-like systems) and as a result many security software suites assume their existence.\r\n\r\nThe embedded world, however, poses a variety of unique challenges (resulting from constraints and deployment scenarios, which differ significantly from the general-purpose world) when designing and implementing (CS)PRNGs. Resulting inadequacies in embedded OS random number generators have led to various security failures in the past (from weak cryptographic keys in network devices to broken exploit mitigations in smartphones) emphasizing the need for public scrutiny of their security, especially considering the nature of embedded system deployments (in everything from vehicles and critical infrastructure to networking equipment) and the sheer variety of ebmedded operating systems compared to the general-purpose world. In this talk we will discuss various challenges posed by the embedded world to (CS)PRNG design and implementation and illustrate our arguments by means of the first public analysis of the OS random number generators of several popular embedded operating systems and a discussion of how their flaws related to these previously identified challenges.

Aber was machte z.B. ein Kaffeeriecher? Er war kein Hipster-Barista, sondern ein Auswuchs der Politik von Friedrich II.: durch den Schmuggel von Kaffeebohnen sah sich Friedrich II gen\u00f6tigt, ausgediente Kriegsveteranen durch Berlin zu schicken. Sie durften in die H\u00e4user der B\u00fcrger eindringen, um unversteuerten Kaffee aufzufinden. Sie verletzten dabei die Privatsph\u00e4re und schn\u00fcffelten buchst\u00e4blich nach einem Vergehen. Anders als die \u00dcberwachung im Netz heute waren sie laut und derb und nicht unsichtbar. Den B\u00fcrgern waren sie so verhasst, dass sie sich gegen sie aufb\u00e4umten. Nach nur acht Jahre war der Spuk vorbei, die Kaffeeriecher wurden durch Protest des Volkes ausrangiert.

Die Fotografien stammen aus einer Zeit, als der Fotograf selbst noch Handwerker war. Anhand der Bilder lassen sich \u00c4sthetik und Funktionalit\u00e4t des neuen Berufes klar erkennen. Das Buch wurde gemeinsam in einem Interview mit dem Bundesarbeitsminister im Radio vorgestellt, es war \u00fcber zwei Jahre lang das wichtigste Buch des Verlags Braun editions.\r\n\r\nIm Folgewerk \u201eDas Zeitalter der Maschinen \u2013 Von der Industrialisierung des Lebens\u201c geht es um den \u00dcbergang in die Industrielle Revolution:\r\n\u201eDie Zeit\u201c schreibt: \u201eSeit der Industrialisierung bestimmen Maschinen unseren Alltag \u2013 damals waren sie aus Eisen und Stahl, und manche \u00fcberlebensgro\u00df.

Doch damals revolutionierten die Maschinen nicht nur die Wirtschaft, sondern das ganze Leben.

In this current moment of climate crisis and structural metamorphosis how can we work with powerful immersive technologies to understand our own perceptual systems, to radically communicate and to innovate new ways of being together?",
                                "description": "Our physical body and the spaces we inhabit seem very real, but what is this sense of reality \u2013 of presence in the world \u2013 and is it simply a story told to us by our brain, a neural fiction? Just over a decade ago, neuroscientists at Princeton discovered the \u2018rubber hand illusion\u2019, a way of persuading the brain to incorporate a fake hand into its internal body image, so that the fake hand became a felt part of the body. Since then, scientists and virtual reality experts have developed \u2018full body\u2019 illusions showing how our attachment to our whole body is somehow provisional and flexible. \r\n\r\nThe talk will consider these strange findings and what potentials are emerging through creative VR projects. I will discuss my own work with Virtual Reality, which investigates how immersive audio, visual, touch and haptic environments enable us to \"slip our moorings\" and experience transformed relationships to our environment, to other people and to our own bodies. I\u2019ll describe the interdisciplinary experimentation undertaken in the Sackler Centre's Labs and the development of visual technologies and multi-sensory techniques that invite audiences to investigate the architecture of their own subjective experience for themselves.\r\nOur understanding of what it is to be human is undergoing a dramatic seachange: a biological, embodied, emotional and fundamentally social understanding of human subjectivity is emerging across disciplines. These powerful immersive technologies and techniques for hacking the human sensory system have uses beyond entertainment. This session will end by outlining some ways ahead for creatively working with this tech to bring us into deeper relationship with the systems we live in and distant ecosystems, other people and the vital feelings of our own bodies.\r\n",

In this talk, we will explain how Citizen Lab discovered and tracked this threat actor, and uncovered the first publicly-reported iOS remote jailbreak used in the wild for mobile espionage. Using the NSO case, we will detail some of the tools and techniques we use to track these groups, and how they try to avoid detection and scrutiny. This investigation is Citizen Lab\u2019s latest expose into the abuse of commercial \u201clawful intercept\u201d malcode. \r\n\r\nWe will begin the presentation with our discovery and investigation of a UAE-based threat actor we call Stealth Falcon, and explain how a small error in the operators\u2019 operational security led us to a mobile attack infrastructure consisting of hundreds of servers, which we determined was associated with NSO\u2019s Pegasus product.  We will detail the Internet scanning we undertook to enumerate this infrastructure, and some techniques we used to try and find \u201clive\u201d exploit links.\r\n\r\nIt was through these techniques that we identified suspicious links sent via SMS to UAE human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor.  We will describe how we caused the exploit server to \u201cfire\u201d, and how we determined that it served us a one-click zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak to deliver NSO\u2019s Pegasus, a powerful and sophisticated piece of government-exclusive malcode.\r\n\r\nWe will outline the functionality of the exploit used against Mansoor, and the Pegasus surveillance malcode, and outline the collaborative research and responsible disclosure process to Apple that led to the out-of-band updates to iOS and macOS.\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of commercial tools for targeted digital surveillance presents a documented risk to activists and civil society. However, there is a silver lining for researchers in this proliferation: by reselling the same commercial \u201clawful intercept\u201d tool and network infrastructure to multiple countries, and training operators in the same attack techniques, companies are creating patterns that we can use to identify surveillance across a wide range of different actors.\r\n\r\nUsing the Mansoor attack as a case study, we will provide a window into how researchers at Citizen Lab leverage and fingerprint these patterns to track nation-state level attacks against human rights defenders and journalists. Drawing on cases from the UAE and beyond, we will discuss how we work with targets and victims, conduct Internet scanning, and fingerprint C&C servers. We will conclude with a discussion of some trends that we have observed in commercial malcode sold to nation state actors.",

The picture at the primary school level is fuzzier, as students do not declare majors at that level, but evidence indicates the trend starts from a young age. Can we make computer education more gender-inclusive? Presenting technology in familiar, non-threatening contexts can lead to more balanced gender participation. For example, Chibitronics uses the context of papercraft to present electronics to beginners; the familiarity of papercraft improves the participation of women of all ages in the creation of electronics. Based on these learnings, we have devised the \u201cLove to Code\u201d platform, an open source hardware-to-cloud stack which combines the familiarity of paper craft with a web-based, driver-free embedded firmware development environment based on FSK audio provisioning via a headphone jack. In this talk, we will dive into the novel open source technical contributions of this platform, which includes the audio-based provisioning protocol and the unique rigid-flex design of the circuitry enabling papercraft integration, as well as the multi-threaded client OS and cloud infrastructure required to complete the picture. This combination of new technology with familiar interfaces aims to lower the barrier to computer education, thus making coding a more accessible and inclusive activity.",

One study from 2002 placed female participation in undergraduate computer education classrooms around 10% for Germany, and 26% for the US[1]. The picture is fuzzier at the primary school level, because students do not declare majors at such a young age, but evidence indicates that this strong gender bias has roots extending to primary school. Can we make computer education more inclusive? There is evidence that presenting technology in familiar, non-threatening contexts can lead to more inclusive participation. \r\n\r\nAs an example, Chibitronics uses the context of paper craft to present electronics to beginners. Paper craft \u2013 the art of manipulating and coating paper as exemplified by origami or painting \u2013 has universal accessibility among almost all ages, genders, and ethnic groups. In our approach, novices start with the familiarity of paper, and combine it with copper tape and electronic stickers to build circuits.\r\n\r\nDemographic analysis of the Chibitronics user base indicates this approach is succeeding at gender inclusivity: over 70% of individual buyers are female. Follow-up interviews indicate that Chibitronics acts as a gateway to more advance projects and skills. After bootstrapping into basic electronics, users pick up skills such as soldering to build larger and more permanent projects. \r\n\r\nWe would like to continue this trend beyond circuit crafting and into the realm of embedded firmware coding. Creating parallel and series combinations of LEDs and switches can only go so far; users rapidly outgrow the basic techniques and want to add patterns and interactivity to their projects through coding.\r\n\r\nCoding for the web is as simple as learning a text editor and pointing a browser at a URL, but coding for an embedded hardware target, such as an Arduino, inevitably requires platform-specific drivers, which can require installation and debugging. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that primary school educators rarely possess the skillset to install, debug, and maintain a classroom of computers for embedded development. Furthermore, the waning popularity of laptops and desktops means the most inclusive platforms are now mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though their touchscreen keyboards are not ideal for extensive programming. \r\n\r\nIn order to tackle the problem of inclusivity, we make embedded firmware development nearly universal by coupling a cloud-based editing and compilation infrastructure with an audio-based firmware upload protocol suitable for implementation on low-cost microcontrollers. Cloud-based editing and compilation eliminates the barrier of downloading and running a C compiler on the client, while the audio-based firmware upload protocol allows virtually any computer, smartphone, or tablet to communicate with target hardware implementing our demodulator. We demonstrate this end-to-end solution via the Chibitronics \u201cLove To Code\u201d (LtC) open source hardware platform.\r\n\r\nUsers code for their LtC boards using Arduino-flavored C++ as a baseline language by visiting our demo site (either https://chibitronics.com/ltc (CodeMirror editor) or https://chibitronics.com/cb (Codebender/ACE editor)). Users enter their code on the client-side editor, which is then uploaded as plain text to a cloud-based C++ compiler and returned as an object code binary. The binary is then packetized, coded and modulated using browser-side Javascript into an FSK audio stream with a baud rate of 8000 bps. The frequency plan was chosen to minimize interaction with audio \u201cenhancement\u201d filters found in devices such as iPhones, and to enable the raw audio stream to be recorded as a 128kbps CBR MP3 with minimal distortion. This allows pre-compiled binaries to be stored as songs; one could even entertain the thought of cutting these songs into vinyl records and provisioning microcontrollers using nothing more than an analog turntable. \r\n\r\nThe FSK audio stream is coupled from the headphone jack into the microcontroller PCB via a modified microUSB cable. The USB interface is used only for power; the data pins are inert during the provisioning process. Audio arrives at the LtC hardware via the \u201cfifth pin\u201d in the microUSB plug that is normally reserved for identifying A or B type devices. This hack allows users to power programmed LtC devices using any regular microUSB cable. \r\n\r\nWithin the LtC device, the audio signal is DC coupled and level-shifted using a passive RC network into a single ADC pin on an NXP CPU, the MKL02Z32VFK4. This 48 MHz Cortex M0+ features 32k of FLASH and 4k of RAM and costs under $1 in modest volumes, less than one third the cost of the AVR used in the Arduino Leonardo. The microcontroller uses noncoherent demodulation to recover the bitstream. The received data is hash-checked for integrity and, if it passes, is committed to FLASH memory. Since our code is open source, one can add FSK audio provisioning to a wide range of microcontrollers with built-in ADCs for the price of a couple resistors and a capacitor.\r\n\r\nBecause microphone jack pin assignments are non-standard between different device ecosystems, we designed the protocol to operate with only forward error correction through trivially redundant transmission of packets. In other words, we cannot rely on a feedback path being available for the device to request a retransmission of a corrupt packet, due to a lack of standardization among microphone interfaces. Fortunately, in our application, the signal to noise ratio is typically quite good and most errors are due to burst noise, e.g. a notification tone generated by another application during device programming. In this scenario, simple hamming codes (such as SECDED) do little to improve robustness of the protocol, and more advanced error correction mechanisms such as BCH codes requires more computational power and storage space than available in our inexpensive target device. As a result, we handle error correction through trivial replication of data by playing the song three times over.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the audio firmware downloader code, the target CPU also runs an implementation of the open source, multi-threaded RTOS ChibiOS (no relationship to Chibitronics despite the Japanese-derived \u201cchibi\u201d prefix). We expose the threading API so that advanced users can create multi-threaded applications on LtC. This is an advantage over the popular Arduino platform, which has no native support for multi-threading.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce code upload times over an 8000bps link to within the \u201cimpatience limit\u201d of an 8-year old, we pre-load the LtC device with common shared library routines, including floating point, string manipulation, a WS2812 RGB LED driver, and primitives for a low speed USB stack. Because of the library pre-load, we are able to reduce the upload time of most simple programs to under two seconds. The built-in libraries, audio demodulation framework, and multi-threaded OS consumes 22k of memory, leaving 10k for user application code.\r\n\r\nLearning from our prior experiences with paper electronics, the physical design of the LtC hardware borrows from familiar and non-threatening interaction paradigms. The LtC circuit board uses a rigi-flex construction: the rigid portion allows for mechanically robust connectors and compatibility with fine-pitch QFN packages, while the flex portion enables seamless integration with paper-based circuit techniques. \r\n\r\nAs a result, users can integrate the LtC hardware into their projects using a variety of techniques, from sticker-like methods to an electronic clipboard paradigm. The electronic clipboard method is well-suited to classroom environments, as it combines unlimited re-use of the LtC hardware with low-cost, quickly customized and paper-craftable circuitry. This combination enables meaningful learning engagements within an hour of two of classroom time, at a price point accessible by non-elite, publicly funded institutions. \r\n\r\nFinally, the entire framework is licensed under an open source license. Our hope is that once a novice is hooked on coding, they can go as deep as they want, perhaps even remixing our hardware and firmware frameworks into new and creative applications we never had never dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThe Chibitronics Love to Code platform is familiar: users with little or no prior technical background find themselves immediately in familiar territory thanks to the papercraft interaction design. It is easy to use: cloud compilation coupled with audio firmware upload ensures compatibility with a broad range of devices from laptops to smartphones. It is accessible: the combination of cost-optimized core technology with paper as a consumable substrate reduces the barrier of access for schools on tight budgets. The net result is an embedded coding framework for inclusive computer education. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] V. Galpin, SIGSCE Bulletin, Vol 34 No 2, 2002 June. \u201cWomen in Computing Around the World\u201d",

There are now 3,518 exoplanets in 2,635 planetary systems confirmed. We\u2019ll discuss how astronomers find planets, and how they learn about the conditions there. How do we pick a colonization target based on the data we can gather when there is no way of sending probes there and getting information back in reasonable time like we do in our solar system?\r\nPart 2 gives an overview of technologies currently available to get humans to other planets, and what that means in terms of humanity\u2019s expansion. We'll also talk about the technology advancements necessary for truly interstellar colonization.",

We generally call this unknown substance \"dark matter\" / \"dark energy\". The recent discovery of gravitational waves gives us a handle on the dark cosmos. We can now listen to invisible events in our universe. But there may also be other methods to shed light on the dark side.",
                                "description": "There is (much) more than meets the eye: 95% of everything there is in the universe does not interact with normal matter. It is completely transparent. Does not emit light. Reflects no light waves. Can be neither seen nor touched. The only reason we know it exists is the fact that this unknown substance curves spacetime: it interacts gravitationally. Hence gravitational wave astronomy can target the entire universe while conventional telescopes are fundamentally limited to only 5% of the cosmos. After the initial direct detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) last year, many more observatories on ground and in space are under construction that will create a wideband gravitational wave detector network. We will be able to listen to stars falling into black holes, colliding galaxies, maybe even artificial sources of gravitational waves, and will find as yet completely unknown objects in the universe.\r\nBut gravitational waves are not the only handle we have on the dark side of the cosmos. Many other research teams aim to directly detect dark matter. The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS) even tries to artificially generate dark matter particles in a controlled laboratory environment. It is under construction at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany. First results are expected as early as 2019.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will give you a brief and fun introduction to cosmology and Einstein's general relativity. We will explore different known sources of gravitational waves and their associated frequency range. You will understand how LIGO detected the first gravitational wave signature. Join us to learn about upcoming earthbound observatories and space missions like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Finally we will turn to detectors that could detect dark matter directly and explore the need for dark matter generators.",

Smart Energy, on the other hand, has been standardized both by governments and by large private utilities.\r\nThis positive regulation made the Smart Energy market one of the largest IoT industries today, with over 100,000,000 smart devices currently implemented at consumer premises by utilities all over the world.\r\n\r\nIn this talk We will dive into the Smart Grid, exploring security issues both in the utility infrastructure and the Smart Meters present at consumers. We will explore the magical world called ZigBee, the confusing world of incomplete RFCs, and the hazardous world of insecure wireless devices that control your electricity grid.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this talk with a much better understanding at what's going on in your city, your energy provider, and, surprisingly, your home; And trust me, it won't make you feel any better.",

Long gone are the days where those modules were GSM/GPRS/EDGE only with ancient ARM7TMDI or ARM926EJS cores and a relatively small-sized firmware in the range of kilobytes to very few megabytes, like on the famous OsmocomBB supported phones.\r\n\r\nModern cellular modems re-use the cellular chipsets of smartphones one or two generations ago, like the MDM9615 used in the iPhone 5.  As those chipsets contain plenty of processors and are quite sophisticated SoCs on their own, one can even find (undocumented) Linux or Android in some modems, which of course makes them a very attractive target for further exploration or running your own code inside the modem.\r\n\r\nWe will give a short overview about the current market of cellular modems, the major chipset suppliers and chipset families and then pick one or two examples and show the methods used for reverse engineering them to a point where they can be used for much more than the AT command or QMI interface officially documented/supported by the manufacturer. This includes the execution of custom code inside modems, as well as protocol tracing of the air-interface.  We'll also look at the FOTA (Firmware Update Over The Air) features, and perform a security analysis of our findings.\r\n\r\nThis talk understands itself following the tradition of various baseband processor related talks at many CCC events of the past decade, including <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/3008.en.html\">25C3: Anatomy of smartphone hardware</a> and <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4735.en.html\">28C3: Reverse-engineering a Qualcomm baseband</a>.\r\n\r\nBoth speakers (Harald Welte and Holger Freyther) have been working on Free Software related to cellular telephony for more than a decade, including projects like <a href=\"http://openmoko.org/\">Openmoko</a>, <a href=\"http://openbsc.osmocom.org/\">OpenBSC</a>, <a href=\"http://bb.osmocom.org/\">OsmocomBB</a> and many other <a href=\"http://osmocom.org/\">Osmocom</a> projects.",

Minds are not accumulators of knowledge about the world. Minds are generative systems: they actively produce the world that we subjectively experience. Ordinary day-time experiences are in fact dreams constrained by sensory data. This simple insight of contemporary cognitive science turns realist notions of embodiment on their head. The idea of the brain as a dreaming machine opens a way to understand the nature of our experiences.\r\n\r\nThis is the proposed fourth installment of a series of presentations about using AI perspectives to understand minds and their relationship to the universe. \"How to build a mind\" (30c3) suggested specifications for an architecture of cognition; \"From computation to consciousness\" (31c3) explored the mind's computational foundations; \"Computational metapsychology\" (32c3) discussed the individual and social construction of meaning. \"Machine dreams\" sketches how the computational machinery of our brains leads to our experience a subjective world. We will look at the conductor theory of consciousness, some of the mental structures contributing to our models of self and world, and the unreasonable effectiveness of neural processes in modeling physics.",

                                "description": "Imagine no WiFi, no cell phones, no bluetooth. (Everything\u2019s better with bluetooth!) \r\nIt is often said that we owe the convenience of all these modern technologies to Hollywood actress Hedy Lamarr and her invention of Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) in the early 1940s. Do we?\r\n\r\nBorn Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler on November 9, 1914, the daughter of an affluent Viennese family became famous at age 18 for starring naked and faking the first onscreen orgasm in history in the Czech-Austrian film \u201cEkstase\u201d \u2013 fame which led to a successful Hollywood career after Hedwig Kiesler emigrated to the USA and renamed herself Hedy Lamarr. \u201cThe most beautiful woman in the world\u201d, as director Max Reinhardt called her, starred in more than two dozen Hollywood movies over the course of twenty years, all the while being bored by the intellectual limitations her job offered. On the subject of what it takes to be a Hollywood sex symbol, she is quoted to have said \u201cAny girl can look glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.\u201d\r\n\r\nLamarr had always been interested in science and technology and wanted to help the United States' war effort during World War II by doing more than just using her fame and physical beauty to sell war bonds and entertaining the troops at the Hollywood Canteen. In her spare time, she thought about torpedoes: powerful, yet hard to control weapons which might hit their targets more precisely when guided by radio signals. Lamarr knew that the problem with radio signals was that they could easily be jammed by the enemy \u2013 and with her co-inventor, pianist and composer George Antheil, she developed a \u201cSecret Communication System\u201d based on the idea of having radio signals hop around frequencies in a seemingly random pattern, making it thereby hard to impossible to interfere with them. A patent was granted to Lamarr and Antheil, but the United States Navy dismissed the technology, in part due to the fact that it had been proposed by an actress and a composer. Lamarr's idea of frequency hopping remained untouched until the 1960s, when the Navy first used it in a buoy signaling submarine locations to airplanes during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the following decades, the military and private companies developed numerous technologies around the idea of frequency hopping, which is found in most digital devices communicating wirelessly today, be it via bluetooth, WiFi, or in cell phones. Hedy Lamarr's legacy, though, remained that of a beautiful Hollywood actress and sex symbol until recently. Only in 2014 were she and Antheil inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, Lamarr was not the first person to think of frequency hopping as a method for making radio signals harder to intercept and jam: none other than Nikola Tesla was granted a U.S. patent in 1903 which does not use the words \u201cfrequency hopping\u201d, but describes changing wireless frequencies to avoid interception of radio communication. During World War I, the German army used a primitive way of frequency hopping to stop the British listening in to their radio communication. It may be an overstatement, therefore, to say that without Hedy Lamarr there would be no bluetooth, no WiFi, no cell phones today. But she did invent a unique way of doing frequency hopping, and many recent patents in frequency hopping spread spectrum technology refer to the Lamarr-Antheil patent as the basis of the field.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Hedy Lamarr, although she resented not being credited for her scientific inventions for most of her life and instead being reduced to a beautiful face and body, she was after all a woman of her (sexist) time: during her later years, she desperately tried to save her looks through multiple plastic surgery, comically distorting her face to the point where she hardly left the house any more and could only be reached by phone. When, in 1997, her work was finally credited for the first time with the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s Pioneer Award, 82-year-old Hedy sent a recorded message: \u201cIn acknowledgement of your honoring me, I hope you feel good as well as I feel good about it, and it was not done in vain. Thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSources:\r\nBarton, Ruth. Hedy Lamarr: The most beautiful woman in film. Lexington, Ky.: University Press of Kentucky, 2010.\r\nF\u00f6rster, Jochen, and Anthony Loder.

We explored the remix-relationships\u2014accessible due the community\u2019s use of open licenses\u2014of more than 200.000 individual designs, tracked an entire week\u2019s new designs for half a year, interviewed more than 80 creators and surveyed over 200 more. This allowed us to develop a deep understanding of the creative processes that take place on the platform.\r\nIn this talk we would like to present our findings. This is of interest to people who care about 3D printing as we can give sort of a behind the scenes view on how ideas come to life here. But it is also interesting to people that care about creativity in general. As what we have found has merit outside of 3D printing, too. In this talk we would like to cover the following: (1) Introduce our research setting and explain why it is useful to study this, (2) provide a consolidated overview on our most interesting findings, and (3) give real life examples for how these findings are transferable to other settings.\r\nWe have presented primary results of the studies at various academic conferences and have a comprehensive paper on the project currently under revision at the Journal of Information Technology (see attached file). We are a group of three university professors and a Ph.D. student. We work on the intersection of information systems, innovation management, product development, and creativity. We believe that many of the people we studied either attend 33C3 or watch talks online and we therefore think that our results would be of interest to this community. Further, we feel that a well structured talk is better and more entertaining than mailing around our academic journal publications to those who are interested. And lastly, we are eager to receive feedback from a more hands-on audience (than what we deal with at academic conferences). It would be especially useful for us to hear of new developments, discuss ideas for follow-up research projects, and get access to creators that would like to work with us in the future.",
                                "description": "When we think about creativity we imagine some lone genius that has an incredible insight. Oftentimes, this understanding goes hand in hand with some form of divine intervention: someone is \u201cblessed\u201d, or literally \u201ctouched by the Gods\u201d. When we look at academic research that deals with creativity we see a fundamentally different picture. Creative insights are no divine interventions, they are almost always recombinations of known building blocks, they are what is now often called \u201cremixes\u201d. For a long time scholars have tried to make these remixes visible. However, this turned out to be pretty complicated. Creatives either do not want to name their sources of inspiration (for instance due to copyright infringements) or they do not exactly recall what inspired them. For the last three years we looked at creators from the realm of 3D printing. On the world\u2019s largest platform for 3D printable designs (Thingiverse) creators are allowed to remix existing designs but in turn have to indicate which designs they used. This open licensing allowed us to study remix relationships across the entire platform. We explored the remix-relationships\u2014accessible due to their use of open licenses\u2014of more than 200.000 individual designs, tracked an entire week\u2019s new designs for half a year, interviewed more than 80 creators and surveyed over 200 more. On the foundation of these empirical observations, we studied the creative processes in regards to four dimensions: (i) the role of remixes in creative communities, (ii) the different patterns of remixing processes, (iii) the surrounding features that facilitate remixes, and (iv) the characteristics of the remixing users. What we found has merit outside of 3D printing as the creative behaviors that we were able to study are transferable to other settings. In this talk we would like to provide an entertaining overview on our finding, provide examples from 3D printing and contrast them to other creative behaviors. We have attached a working paper that is currently under revision at the Journal of Information Technology. This paper will provide more detail on what we did methodologically. It also entails a couple of figures that illustrate both research setting and findings well. Our research is exploratory in nature. That means we did not start with a clear set of hypotheses like many research projects do. Such a form of research is typical if you want to understand \r\nmore about an under-researched phenomenon. In our case we wanted to find out how remixing in a digital setting works, and how important it is for creative communities. After studying the setting we conclude our research with five propositions. These are basically guidelines that sum up our findings. These five are: (P1) Remixes pose a major source of innovation in open online communities besides the emergence of isolated designs. (P2) Remixes occur in the form of several different, clearly distinguishable evolutionary paths including convergent and divergent patterns. (P3) The co-existence of different design categories allows for cross-category remixes, which are asymmetric with categories tending to either donate or absorb ideas. (P4) The effectiveness of remixing in online platforms and their attractiveness to different user groups is influenced by a variety of platform features for browsing and processing its contents. (P5) To foster innovation in online communities, platforms need to address the needs and interests of different user groups, each characterized by distinct preferences regarding platform features. Overall we were struck by how important remixing is for the creative process we see in the 3D printing community. And we hope that our research will on the one hand provide more creatives with and understanding how others come to solutions and on the other hand ignite a discussion on the importance of remixing for creative processes in general. More research on this is needed and also platforms need to address this aspect of creativity better.",

Ideally, this means it's a device-unique unchanging identifier, which can be used for improving security. However, it can be at odds with privacy and anonymity. This talk will give you an overview of the thirty years of history behind PUFs, and will include the most recent advances in research.

They all have unique properties that are impossible[1] to reproduce, even when using the same manufacturing process. These properties can be turned into physically unclonable functions, or PUFs for short, yielding an object-bound unique identifier. This makes you trackable, but since you're being tracked anyway, you might as well put some of this to good use.\r\n\r\nThe idea of PUFs is not new, and can be traced back several decades to anti-counterfeiting measures in currency. Since then, several formalizations have been proposed, new types of PUFs have been invented, implemented, attacked, and scrutinized. PUFs can be used to identify and authenticate devices. They can be used to secure your boot process. Some PUF constructions can be used to enhance your random number generation. You might be using devices right now that have properties that can be turned into PUFs, provided you have the tools and want to do some programming.\r\n\r\nThis talk will take you on a brief tour of the history of PUFs. Along the way, it will show you how a PUF is constructed, what its properties should be, what it can be used for, what materials and devices are known to be suitable for building one, and how you might go about searching for them in your own devices.\r\n\r\n[1] For certain definitions of impossible.",

That would presently include, however, its biggest flaw: The utter lack of anonymity. In fact, the famed Bitcoin blockchain is the world's most robust, transparent, and <em>public</em> financial accounting system ever.\r\n\r\nThe above means that Bitcoin's potential widespread adoption is nothing short of a privacy horror scenario straight out of Orwell. Every toilet paper purchase publicly recorded, verified, stamped, and approved. This should not be news to anyone.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, a few reputable cryptographers came up with some mathematical magic that would, if integrated into Bitcoin, enable anonymous transactions. This proposal has been described in an academic paper under the name Zerocoin and a year later improved in another paper under the name Zerocash. The plan had then shifted to establishing the system as an anonymous <em>altcoin</em> rather than to push for integration into Bitcoin itself. Zcash is the name of a company formed by the authors of Zerocash to develop and launch this altcoin; launch occured as planned on 28 October 2016.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the audience to the mathematical and technical background of Zcash, and report on the state of the currency two months after its launch. A degree in mathematics is not required.\r\n\r\nNote: The presenter is not affiliated with the Zcash company.",

His Drone Shadow installations have appeared on city streets worldwide, he has mapped deportation centres with CGI, designed new kinds of citizenship based on online behaviour. and used neural networks and satellite images to predict election results. A New Dark Age is an exploration of what we can no longer know about the world, and what we can do about it.\r\n\r\n",
                                "description": "The history of computation and the history of the weather are deeply intertwined. The possibilities of mathematical prediction have driven a belief in our ability to model and control the world. Today, the pervasive metaphor of \"the Cloud\" shapes how we think about the world - but not always in useful or democratic ways. James Bridle's Cloud Index explored this history and sets out a new model for thinking about the world with the cloud at its heart: a nebulous, ever-changing set of possibilities, founded on unknowing.\r\n\r\nThe Cloud Index (http://cloudindx.com, 2016) is an online artwork using neural networks to generate new weather patterns corresponding to differing electoral outcomes. The work challenges our ability to predict and thus control the future, and questions our intentions and ethics when it comes to the things we build.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cloud Index as a starting point, Bridle's lecture explores the military and political histories of computation, networking, and weather control. As the processes of computational thinking - the belief that the gathering of ever-increasing volumes of data and the application of vast engines of computing power - fail to produce coherence or agency in the world, Bridle suggests that we should take the Cloud at its word. Cloud thinking is the acknowledgement that we cannot know or predict everything, and our technology is trying to teach us a different way of seeing and understanding the world.",

                                "description": "  Climate change is the most pressing issues ever faced by humans.  While many people are aware of the need for renewable energy, electric vehicles and more efficient homes and manufacturing, fewer people are aware that animal agriculture is a major issue which must be addressed.  In fact animal agriculture is one of the highest impact human activities, producing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental damage on par with worldwide transportation and industrial manufacturing.\r\n  Rather than convincing people to give up animal products, some groups (academic, industrial and biohackers) are using science to produce near-identical, or in some cases identical, replacements for these products.  Replacing animal products will greatly reduce the environmental impact of our diets, without making people give up the food they desire.\r\n  I will discuss various approaches including plant protein databases used for engineering realistic animal product replacement, production of proteins in genetically modified microorganisms, and culturing of animal cells without the growing of a whole animal.  The science behind these approaches, potential impact, and progress by various players in these fields will be presented.  Finally I give a progress update on the Real Vegan Cheese project, which is run out of biohacker spaces in the SF bay area and aims to produce real cheese from engineered yeast.",

How do networks of online platforms, tech companies and data brokers really collect, analyze, trade and make use of personal data? What can be inferred from our purchases, web searches and likes? How is analytics based on personal information already used in fields such as insurance, finance, healthcare and employment to treat people differently?

                                "description": "Memory deduplication is a widely applied technique to reduce memory consumption in servers, VM hosts, desktop systems and even mobile devices. Deduplication maps multiple identical copies of a physical page onto a single shared copy with copy-on-write semantics. As a result, a write to such a shared page triggers a page fault and is thus measurably slower than a write to a unshared page. Prior work has shown that an attacker able to craft pages on the target system can use this timing difference as a simple single-bit side channel to discover that certain pages exist in the system.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we show that the security implications of using memory deduplication are much more severe than initially assumed. We show that by maliciously programming memory deduplication, an attacker can build primitives to read arbitrary data from memory and even write to memory in a limited but powerful way. We exemplify these primitives using three attacks that we have recently developed.\r\n\r\nThe first attack, CAIN, uses memory deduplication to brute-force ASLR\u2019s entropy bits from a co-hosted victim VM. The second attack, Dedup Est Machina, extends CAIN in order to leak arbitrary data such as ASLR heap/code pointers and password hashes in a victim\u2019s browser from JavaScript. Using the leaked pointers, Dedup Est Machina uses a Rowhammer exploit to own Microsoft Edge without relying on a single software vulnerability. The third attack, Flip Feng Shui, uses memory deduplication to control the placement of a co-hosted victim VM\u2019s sensitive information on physical memory for building a sophisticated Rowhammer attack on RSA public keys. Flip Feng Shui makes cross-VM Rowhammer attacks precise, fast and reliable. As an example, Flip Feng Shui compromises the OpenSSH server of a victim VM in less than 10 minutes in 84% of the cases.\r\n\r\nWe conclude memory deduplication is fatal for security in more ways than one.\r\n\r\nSpeaker BIOs:\r\n\r\n\r\nKaveh\r\nKaveh Razavi is a security researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

                                "description": "Embedded systems are widely used today in a variety of applications, such as consumer, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military. As such, they are often employed in mission critical systems that have to be both reliable and secure. In particular, it is important that their I/O (Input/Output) be stable and secure, as this is the way they interact with the outside world. \r\n\r\nDigging into their architecture, we know that the I/O interfaces of embedded systems (e.g., GPIO, SCI, USB, etc.), are usually controlled by a so-called System on a Chip (SoC), an integrated circuit that combines multiple I/O interfaces. In turn, the pins in a SoC are managed by a pin controller, a subsystem of SoC, through which one can configure pin multiplexing or the input or output mode of pins. One of the most peculiar aspects of a pin controller is that its behavior is determined by a set of registers: by altering these registers one can change the behavior of the chip in a dramatic way. This feature is exploitable by attackers, who can tamper with the integrity or the availability of legitimate I/O operations, factually changing how an embedded system interacts with the outside world. Based on these observations, in this research, we introduce a novel attack technique against embedded systems, which we call pin control attack. As we will demonstrate in the work, the salient features of this new class of attacks are:\r\nFirst, it is intrinsically stealth. The alteration of the pin configuration does not generate any interrupt, preventing the OS to react to it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is entirely different in execution from traditional techniques such as manipulation of kernel data structures or system call hooking, which are typically monitored by anti-rootkit protection systems.\r\nFinally, it is viable. It is possible to build concrete attack using it.\r\nTo demonstrate these points, we first present and demonstrate the attack capabilities offered by Pin Control attack, together with the minimal requirements for carrying out the attack. We argue that the attack capabilities include blocking the communication with a peripheral, causing physical damage to the peripheral, and manipulating values read or written by legitimate processes. We show how pin control can be exploited both with and without the attacker having kernel-level or root access.\r\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of our attack technique, we describe the practical implementation of an attack against a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) environment by exploiting the runtime configuration of the I/O pins used by the PLC to control a physical process. The attack allows one to reliably take control of the physical process normally managed by the PLC, while remaining stealth to both the PLC runtime and operators monitoring the process through a Human Machine Interface, a goal much more challenging than simply disabling the process control capabilities of the PLC, which would anyway lead to potentially catastrophic consequences. The attack does not require modification of the PLC logic or traditional kernel tampering or hooking techniques, which are normally monitored by anti-rootkit tools.\r\nWe present two variations of the attack implementation. The first implementation allows an extremely reliable manipulation of the process at the cost of requiring root access. The second implementation slightly relaxes the requirement of reliable manipulation while allowing the manipulation to be achieved without root access.\r\nFinally, we discuss potential mechanisms to detect/prevent Pin Configuration exploitation. However, because the pin configuration does happen legitimately at runtime and the lack of proper interrupt notifications from the SoC, it seems non-trivial to devise monitoring techniques that are both reliable and sufficiently light way to be employed in embedded systems.\r\n",

To meet these demands, a new ultrasound-based technology has recently emerged and is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications. Ultrasound tracking comes with a number of desirable features (e.g., easy to deploy, inaudible to humans), but alarmingly until now no comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been conducted. In this talk, we will publish the results of our security analysis of the ultrasound tracking ecosystem, and demonstrate the practical security and privacy risks that arise with its adoption.

                                "description": "This talk will present the outcomes of the first comprehensive security study on the ultrasound tracking ecosystem.\r\n \r\nThis ecosystem remained almost unknown to the general public until recently, when a newly-founded company faced the nemesis of the security community and the regulators (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission) for its controversial tracking techniques. However, there are many more \u201ctraditional players\u201d using ultrasound tracking techniques for various purposes, raising a number of levels of security and privacy issues with different security and privacy models.\r\n \r\nIn general, the main advantage of the ultrasound technology compared to already existing solutions is that it does not require any specialized equipment (unlike wifi and bluetooth), while it remains inaudible to humans.  For this reason, the technology is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications, such as device pairing, proximity detection, and cross-device tracking. From a technical perspective, ultrasound tracking is based an ecosystem featuring multiple participating entities (e.g., the users, the advertisers, the content providers, the tracking provider).\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we will present the first comprehensive and in-depth security analysis of ultrasound tracking technology and the surrounding ecosystem. More specifically, we will provide visibility within the ecosystem\u2019s walled garden, examine the different facets of the ultrasound technology, explain how it is currently used in the real world, and subsequently evaluate the privacy and security of the technology itself and the existing deployments.\r\n \r\nBased on our findings, we will then introduce a new class of attacks against ultrasound tracking mechanisms, along with analysis of real-world Android apps featuring ultrasound frameworks. In particular, we will show how an ultrasound cross-device tracking framework can be abused to perform stealthy de-anonymization attacks (e.g., to unmask users who browse the Internet through anonymity networks such as Tor), to inject fake or spoofed audio beacons, and to leak users\u2019 private information.\r\n \r\nIn the mitigation part of our talk, we will outline immediately deployable defenses that empower practitioners, researchers, and everyday users to protect their privacy. In particular, we will release a browser extension and an Android permission module that enable users to selectively suppress frequencies falling within the ultrasonic spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn the last part of our talk, we would like to engage in discussion with the audience regarding the  standardization of ultrasound beacons, and share our design of a flexible OS-level API that addresses both the effortless deployment of ultrasound-enabled applications and the existing privacy and security problems.\r\n",

LoRa is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), an emerging class of wireless technology optimized for embedded and Internet of Things focused applications.  LoRa is unique because it uses a chirp spread spectrum modulation that encodes data into RF features more commonly encountered in RADAR systems.  LoRa is also designed to operate in unlicensed ISM frequency bands, both avoiding costly spectrum licensing requirements and democratizing long-range network infrastructure to consumers and new commercial operators alike.  After briefly introducing the audience to LPWANs, I will walk through the SDR and DSP techniques required to demodulate and decode LoRa packets.

Das Ziel des Talks ist, euch dabei zu helfen, Lernprozesse um Motivationsfaktoren in euren eigenen Tech-/FOSS-Communities besser zu unterst\u00fctzen, verschiedenste Erfahrungen zusammenzutragen und existierende Ideen weiterzuentwickeln.\r\n\r\nCommunities, insbesondere im FOSS-Bereich, k\u00f6nnen ohne ehrenamtliches Engagement kaum \u00fcberleben. Doch die Anerkennung und Wertsch\u00e4tzung dieses Engagements kommt h\u00e4ufig zu kurz. Gleichzeitig kommen immer wieder Open-Source-Projekte, auf denen unsere technische und zivilgesellschaftliche Infrastruktur aufbaut, zum Erliegen. Doch was ist, wenn sich das Problem nicht mit Geld l\u00f6sen l\u00e4sst?\r\n\r\nWir gehen in unserem Talk der These nach, dass Anerkennungskultur nicht nur durch vorrangig technische L\u00f6sungen (wie z.\u00a0B. Geld oder auch meritokratische Herangehensweisen), sondern auch durch soziale L\u00f6sungen entsteht. Bei Jugend hackt haben wir seit vier Jahren die M\u00f6glichkeiten, verschiedenste Formen von Anerkennungskultur und Wertsch\u00e4tzung zu erproben. Wir m\u00f6chten diese Erfahrungen mit euch teilen und mit Anerkennungsformen anderer Communities vergleichen und dabei Erfolgsfaktoren und Hinderungsgr\u00fcnde sichtbar machen.\r\n\r\nAu\u00dferdem werden wir folgende Fragen beantworten: Wie weit reicht intrinsische Motivation? Welche W\u00fcrdigungen gibt es au\u00dfer Geld? Wie funktioniert Lernen und gegenseitige Motivation in solchen Communities? Und was haben (Open) Badges damit zu tun?",

While the devices have gotten smaller, because of the increasingly networked nature of technology the room has gotten bigger--it's ceased having walls and started to cover the ocean floor and ascend into low earth orbit. While Neal Stephenson may have cornered this living-inside-a-computer narrative in 1996 with \"Mother Earth, Mother Board\", in the past twenty years the seams of the network have become even more opaque, subsumed into The Cloud and other problematic abstractions. This talk will mostly be about different approaches to documenting, comprehending, and thinking about network infrastructure and the ways that the visual vernacular of technologies shape their history and politics. \r\n\r\n",

We will see how certain elements of hacking ethos could be reprised in CERN or energy lab. I will also show some findings about well recognized effects in science, which are also valid in the open-source communities. Perhaps actual details of science resembles hacking more than hackers suspect?   \r\n\r\nSecond part will focus on comparisons between knowledge about laboratories and results from my study of hacking communities.

We will see how sociology uses term \u201cblack box\u201d and how social history of sexual diseases might help us to untangle some discussions in IT security. \r\n\r\nThird part wil briefly focus on the possible futures of formal laboratories, hacking collectives and other social institutions.

The title derives from a social network induced anxiety condition. One brought on by trying to keep up with a rapidly moving world. A fear of constantly being one-step behind, in the wrong place, and missing out on the most exciting events. The Fear Of Missing Out proposes that it is possible to be one step ahead of the art world by using well-crafted algorithms and computational logic.\r\n\r\nThe works in the show are the result of a computer algorithm written by Lund. By analysing and categorizing a wide range of artworks, by the most successful contemporary artists, a set of instructions were generated explaining, step by step, how to make the most successful works of art. The artist then simply made the work following the instructions. In The Fear of Missing Out, important categories from the art world such as authenticity, artistry, talent, and creativity are questioned. The title also refers to the urge to be a part of a transparent information society made up of an overarching digital network.\r\n\r\nFlip City\r\nhttp://jonaslund.biz/works/flip-city/\r\nSteve Turner Contemporary is pleased to present Flip City, a solo exhibition by Amsterdam-based artist Jonas Lund, who will present a group of paintings that are inspired by the current appetite for process-based abstraction; the related trend of collectors/investors buying such works to flip them quickly for a profit; and the central role that Los Angeles has played in both realms.\r\n\r\nFor Flip City, Lund will create forty digital paintings, of which a selection will be on view during the run of the exhibition and the others will be presented at art fairs in Europe, Latin America and the United States during the next twelve months. Each work has elements sampled from paintings by other emerging artists, yet Lund\u2019s works are so thoroughly remixed that only a very astute observer might see familiar passages. Lund will install a GPS tracking device on the stretcher bar of each painting so that he can track its movements and approximate whereabouts. He will also maintain a website with this information in the years to come.\r\n\r\nSTRINGS ATTACHED\r\nhttp://jonaslund.biz/works/strings-attached/\r\n\r\nSteve Turner is pleased to present Strings Attached, a solo exhibition by Amsterdam-based artist Jonas Lund which will feature 24 text-based paintings that relate to the current \u201cbubble moment\u201d in contemporary art. Each work uses text that restricts the transfer of ownership in some way, such as \u201cThis painting may never be sold at auction\u201d or \u201cThis painting must be resold by March 21, 2017.\u201d Lund uses fabric wallpaper as backgrounds for the works, and their messages have been painted by a sign painter according to Lund\u2019s directions. As a group, the 24 paintings encompass contradictory efforts made by gallerists who both want to fuel market momentum for their artists while trying to shield them from the damaging effects of quick-profit speculation.\r\n",

Governments have tried to control information for as long as they have existed, but new technologies have changed censorship significantly. Internet censorship today is widespread. Governments and companies differ in both the extent of their censorship and the technical implementation. I conceptualize censorship as falling on a continuum between the theoretical ideal state of \u201cno censorship\u201d, most closely approximated by Iceland (Freedom on the Net 2014) and pervasive censorship and isolation, like in North Korea. \r\n\r\nIn the series of papers I am currently writing as part of my PhD in Economics, I focus on both theoretical arguments on the possible costs (and benefits?) of censorship for economies, and try to construct a reliable estimate. Having a background in China was a main motivation for this project, as censorship is so wide-spread there. The US has recently dubbed \u201cThe Great Firewall\u201d protectionism, but did not further elucidate what is meant by this. \r\n\r\nThe economic effects of internet censorship have not been studied comprehensively yet. However, with our move towards an information society, and the rise of an \u201cinternet industry\u201d, censorship is clearly becoming more important. We see censorship shaping entire industries in countries like China, where the government outsourced some of its censorship activities to select firms. Even beyond extreme examples of censorship like China, the impact on economic activities in a society seems self-evident. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I touch on the theoreotical model I am developing, and try to estimate the economic effects of censorship. In doing so, I also try to understand which forms of censorship are most costly for an economy. I believe that societies currently loose a lot of economic welfare through censorship, in addition to the social and political costs that have been focused on previously. In addition, I focus on the difficulties in obtaining data for such a politically-sensitive topic.",

In the Enlightenment Encyclopedia it is described as the new disease of a wounded conscience and a heinous sin. Surprisingly, the Christian Church was not responsible. It had, until then, never regarded masturbation as anything other than a marginal problem for adult men (and especially monks). \r\n\r\nThe people responsible for making masturbation a sin were economists, who worried about the consequences of masturbation for productivity in an economy that depended on the endless desire for more. The condemnation of masturbation spread, and in no time, doctors were making scientific claims to prove the dangers of masturbation, while priests made it their new obsession. \r\n\r\nIn the confessional, the sinners had to avow everything, not only their reprehensible actions, but their reprehensible dreams, the languorous images that crossed their consciousness, the birth of desire in their troubled mind. The priests demanded to know it all, the most inner thoughts of the masturbators. The sinner was meant to keep his own mind under surveillance.\r\n\r\nToday, we believe that we have overcome this obscure period. Masturbation is widely accepted as a healthy sexual practice. But most importantly, our liberal democracies strongly posit that public ethics should remain neutral regarding sexuality, and that each one of us is free to have the sexuality that we prefer, enjoy, and that no institution is authorized to morally judge us for our sexual activities. \r\n\r\nYet, I want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized by the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to make us conform to a new form of puritan morality. Just as the 18th century priests did in their Churches, the high priests of the digital age listen to our confessions, record them, and eventually make us repent. \r\n \r\nWho doesn\u2019t have a relative, a friend, a colleague, who broke up because of an iMessage showing up on the wrong device, fooled by the iCloud, by a suspicious Facebook like, or a Pokemon caught in the wrong neighborhood? \r\n\r\nThe economic interests of having us behave morally are numerous: the best customer is predictable, and who is more predictable than an obedient child, or a pious wife or husband? From the pithy history of masturbation to real life break-ups, I will demonstrate the dark connections between digital surveillance, neoliberal economics and morality. \r\n\r\nI am a researcher at Columbia University and Sciences Po Paris in political philosophy. I am an expert of the Snowden case and digital surveillance. This will be my first talk on masturbation. ",

But also, diseases can be diagnosed or predicted by analyzing the genome. More and more research is committed to finding clues for diseases in our genes. The opportunity is clear: If I know about a disease I might get ahead of time, I could possibly intervene before it starts. Yet: How accurate are these predictions and how meaningful are they? And more importantly: What happens to my genetic data once it has been decoded?",
                                "description": "Genetic data is quite valuable, but not just for researchers, but also for health insurances, other insurers, law enforcement and employers. However, that genomic data can always be re-identified, since it is a unique pattern. Therefore, genomic data needs to be secured.\r\nIn my talk, I would like to point out the possibilities which have arisen by whole genome sequencing, that is the complete decoding and analysis of one person\u2019s genome. This milestone of biological research is important for medical advances such as personalized medicine. But it is also subject to commercialization. For ever more decreasing prices, one person can easily sequence their own genome and get access to information on heritage and possible risks of genetic diseases. This means that private companies are accumulating massive amounts of whole genome data. Additionally, third parties could send in probes of other people, which they can get quite easily. But how do we interpret the data? Even though people tend to believe that the genome holds many answers to diseases and risks, this has been a misconception. For most diseases, the environment, lifestyle and maybe even just bad luck play a much more important role.\r\nStill, many researchers are trying to analyze more and more genomes, especially in cancer research. Genetic predispositions for cancer are usually quite small probabilities, so a large sample size is needed to get reliable results. The limitless demand for more data is problematic on its own; however, getting informed consent from donors is also a problem. Once sequenced, one whole genome sequence can be about 150GB in size, which causes problems for transmitting and analyzing it. Today, genomes are shared via cloud or, interestingly, on hard drives via post. But international exchange of data also means that different legal and data security standards are mixed.\r\nWhole Genome Sequencing provides us with opportunities for medical and biological science, but with challenges in ethics and privacy.

                                "description": "The Nintendo Game Boy was an 8-bit handheld gaming console that competed with the SEGA Game Gear and the Atari Lynx. Compared to its competition, it had very little RAM (8 KB) and no color support (4 shades of gray at 160x144). It was succeeded by the Game Boy Color, which fixed this main shortcoming, but shared the same architecture. During the 14 year life span of the 8 bit Game Boy platform, game programmers kept understanding the hardware better and better, and continued finding new tricks for better graphics effects, such as sprite multiplexing, parallax and palette effects. This talk explains all the hardware details of the Game Boy: The programming model of the 8080/Z80-like LR35902 CPU, the system's sound, timer and I/O functionality, and programming details as well as common tricks involving the graphics processor (\"PPU\"), which was specifically designed for LCD output. The listener will get a good understanding of 8 bit programming and creative programming on extremely limited hardware, as well as common tricks that can be generalized to other systems.",

The talk focuses on mass surveillance based on methods known from research of the interdiscplinary field of Computationanal Linguistics (or Natural Language Processing) and demonstrates how generation of selectors for mass surveilling text messages can occur.",
                                "description": "Since the globalized Echelon system of the NSA surveillance complex was reveilled in 1988 by investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, it's known that keyword-based surveillance forms exist, which classify as mass surveillance, because all communications in reach are affected.\r\n\r\nHowever, little knowledge is available concerning the nature of these words, which are supposed to be the needles the secret services search for in the haystack. Even though different leaks exist, showing different forms of hard selectors (like telephone numbers or email addresses of high-ranking policians or economic actors), there's also evidence for soft selectors, targeting no specific persons, but whole groups or populations.\r\n\r\nThere's no clear knowledge available of how such selectors are defined. However, combining insights from Snowden and WikiLeaks documents, taking into account the \"neutral\" state-of-the-art research in the field of Computational Linguistics and Human Language Technology, but also specific surveillance research (e.g., from the EU-sponsored INDECT project including their scaring assumptions about human nature) and own experiments done by the author during his research, a much deeper understanding of the selectors' nature can be achieved. As such, the talk helps to demistify the COMINT work and turns its supposed \"secret knowledge\" to the public. The talk also shows that the application of such methods by principle suffer from catastrophic false-positive rates, thus affecting lots of innocent people in any case, even though governments wants us to believe the opposite, telling us stories of precise searches being carried out only.\r\n\r\nThe speaker by education is Computational Linguist, Sociologist and Neuroinformatician. As activist of the Chaos Computer Club in Switzerland (CCC-CH), he not only fought a surveillance law introducing extended mass surveillance \u2013 including selector search of communications in Switzerland, but also focused his master thesis on exactly this topic.",

Furthermore, new recording technologies beyond simple audio/video recordings become available: 360\u00b0 videos, tactile recorders and even odor recorders are becoming available. . The new recording technology and the massive amounts of data require new means for selecting, displaying and sharing experiences. \r\n\r\n",
                                "description": "Sharing experiences and knowledge have always been essential for human development. They enable skill transfers and empathy. Over history, mankind developed from oral traditions to cultures of writing. With the ongoing digital revolution, the hurdles to share knowledge and experiences vanish.  Already today it is, for example, technically feasible to take and store 24/7 video recordings of one's\u2019 life. While this example creates massive collections of data, it makes it even more challenging to share experiences and knowledge with others in meaningful ways.\r\n\r\nA recurring theme in science fiction literature is the download of the abilities of another human to one's mind. Although current cognitive science and neuroscience strongly suggest that this is impossible, as our minds are embodied; we believe that skill transfer and effective learning will accelerate tremendously given recent technological trends; just to name a few of the enabling technologies, human augmentation using virtual/augmented reality, new sensing modalities (e.g. affective computing) and actuation (e.g. haptics), advances in immersive storytelling (increasing empathy, immersion, communication)  etc. \r\n\r\nThe talk starts with sensing and actuation technology, giving an overview about them and discussing how they can be used.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m discussing several novel upcoming sensing modalities for VR and AR, first of all eye movement analysis for interaction and activity recognition, introducing the pupil eye tracker (open source eye tracker from pupil labs), affective wear (one of our research to track facial expressions on affordable smart glasses) to J!NS MEME (EOG glasses that can detect how much you are reading and how attentive you are). \r\n\r\nIn the next part of the talk I go into details about actuation.Here I especially discuss haptics.\r\nFrom the TECHTILE Toolkit (a rapid prototyping haptic toolkit from two of my colleagues Kouta Minamizawa and Masashi Nakatani) to the REZ Infinite Haptic Suit.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I give an outlook on projects that push the limits for experience sharing and skill transfer: the Swiss Cybathlon and the Japanese Super Human Sports Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a researcher in the wearable computing, AR and VR field organizing a Dagstuhl Seminar on a similar topic, I\u2019m also a founding member of the Japanese Super Human Sports Society.",

It forms the foundation for bottom-up surveillance of personal data that would otherwise be too difficult for a government surveillance program to collect. Data including your most personal photos, messages, and movements are routinely collected and sold by commercial services. Retail surveillance also poses risks for data breaches and leaks and enables new forms of psychological and behavioral monitoring that aim to influence and control the behaviors of \"consumers\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest concern today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/25/philip-zimmermann-king-encryption-reveals-fears-privacy\">said</a> Phil Zimmerman (2015), is not software backdoors, but the petabytes of information being hoarded by the likes of Google and Facebook. Silent Circle co-founder Mike Janke has also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p033l4k6\">voiced concern</a> over this type of surveillance and data collection warning that \"the data companies of the world have more data on you than GCHQ does, absolutely.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This talk will survey current and emerging trends and technologies used in retail surveillance with the goal of enabling others to create a more informed retail-surveillance threat model, countersurveillance workarounds, and knowledge for protest/democratic participation.</p>",

Is the city the answer to a new digital ecosystem, with effective mechanisms to enforce it, in the local government powers? \r\n\r\nSophisticated surveillance systems are approved by, funded by and deployed by local authorities, Cities are emerging as the spaces where everything is controlled by invisible technology, almost imperceptible in daily life. Those surveillance cameras now visible on street corners are replaced by systems of constant monitoring integrated in the landscape. Cities of sensors collecting our data all day long, where each movement is registered and stored, where decisions are automated and dehumanised. Monetised to optimise consumption, predict behaviour. Control people and the local and micro local level. \r\n\r\nBut cities are also the spaces where a different form of politics is emerging, from Rome to Barcelona, from Madrid to Paris, citizens are taking back the domestic infrastructure.

                                "description": "Today, cities of sensors collecting our data all day long, where each movement is registered and stored, where decisions are automated and dehumanised. Monetised to optimise consumption, predict behaviour. Control people. The benefits of not knowing who decides and why, stand to be gained by the same conglomerate who bets on this vision. A few companies developing software, hardware and capacities in countries that can be counted on one hand. A market of US$8 billion, which is expected to grow tenfold by the year 2020. \r\n\r\nAlthough discourses keep feeding the imaginary, descriptions of cameras detecting pickpockets, this is something radically different. Matrices that combine lots of data in real-time. This vision for the city of the future, promoted by a small group of technology conglomerates, is one where quality of life is directly proportional to the predictability and homogeneity of its inhabitants, clashing with the struggle for diversity and diverse behaviors. To achieve this vision, much more is sacrificed than privacy. We pawn off our security to those in the sealed-off control room. It is to sacrifice the purest form of democracy we have, our right to protest freely and anonymously in the town square.\r\n\r\nThe talk will explore how local surveillance systems are rapidly expanding across Latin America and Asia. Much earlier and faster than the regulatory frameworks for adequate protection of privacy and personal data. Without democratic mechanisms, community or neighbourhood consultations to determine their necessity or appropriateness. \r\n\r\nThe talk will also look into the public policy and budgetary implications of the surveillance city, when contracts that are signed tie the hands of more than one public institution, borrowing from future municipal budgets, with a coordinated marketing and data machinery that does not offer solid evidence to prove effectiveness. Public authorities assure us that cameras, scenario modelling and mass surveillance will eliminate the problem of insecurity, advancing these over other public policies meant to attack extreme poverty and inequality of access to basic services, as well as the recovery of public space. The studies that vouch for the effectiveness of surveillance as a crime reduction measure are incomplete; they do not take local internal and external factors into account, and cannot be applied to different contexts.\r\n\r\nThe talk will also look into current efforts to reverse the smart city model into a humane city and how the local power could be the formula to challenge the surveillance space and take back our fundamental rights. \r\n",

I will also show some of my personal works in this field, ranging from passive radio antenna stations towards universal modems to transform existing conductive architecture into a computer network.\r\n\r\nAs a hybrid between computer scientist and media artist, I am creating works at the intersection of engineering, sculpture and formal aesthetics, which investigate power relations between citizens and technology, and often also the relations between citizens and the state. In my latest works, I am pondering how technology can be capable of re-democratizing public space, and how the issues surrounding the creation of private spaces through technological means can be artistically addressed. As a computer scientist, I have worked in high-tech environments and published scientific articles in the fields of artificial intelligence and digital culture.",

Modern liberal states are based upon the assumption that there is no single best way to live, and that for the state to endorse a substantive vision of the good life is to open the door to totalitarianism. On matters of personal conviction \u2013 human nature, our place in the cosmos, and our ultimate goals \u2013 liberal states want us to agree to disagree. \r\n\r\nHowever, we cannot simply agree to disagree about transhumanism because our individual choices will affect the entire species. If you decide to upload your brain onto a computer and abandon your biological body, you are choosing what is essential to humanity: you are defining human nature. If, on the other hand, the government bans technological enhancement, it is also imposing a vision of humanity. Thus, only once liberalism abandons the pretense of neutrality can we start imagining alternative technological futures and debating the underlying vision of the good life that will orient our choice.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a political theory researcher at Sciences Po, and this talk draws on modern political theories of liberalism, the latest transhumanist literature, and ancient Greek theories of the good life.",

Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will enjoy new powers like bulk hacking while having reinforced their existing rights of mass surveillance. At the same time, a proper form of oversight is all but missing. Other countries such as China have even defended their own terrorism bills pointing at this very piece of legislation.\r\n\r\nAmid loud privacy and civil right concerns, the Bill has already passed the House of Commons where only 5\u00a0% of casted votes opposed it.\r\n\r\nBut, does this reflect the will of the electorate? Is this the lesson from the Snowden revelations that we are going to see more not less infringements on civil rights?\r\n\r\nThe talk will also answer the question how the bill\u2019s provisions compare to other initiatives like the new BND law in Germany or the Patriot Act in the USA.",
